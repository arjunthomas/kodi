Just a while ago.
Near the old jetty.

Your wife Ragini has

00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:04,644
Who is it?

00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:08,986
Fresh chicken gravy,

l'm not afraid of you.

41
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,508
Unable to fight like a man,

This is your life's biggest mistake.

51
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,137
Kidnapping me.

00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:17,485
She may drown.

53
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:22,462
No, she'll not, still 14 hours
to blow the conch.

54
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:25,662
Let her take three dips.

55
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,307
Can't you see it's a police jeep?

56
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,590
Why are you waving hands?
Speak!

57
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,984
Open the gate.

58
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:12,492
l swear l'm a police man...
- You fool!

59
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:15,003
Why are you singing without
bothering who is here?

60
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,265
Missed the beat, boy.

61
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,606
On a bullock cart...

00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:26,039
Picking up the groom,
going through the forest, police man...

63

What's that?

67
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,453
Shut your gob and open the gate.

00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,354
Okay, first have this.

Catch him!

71
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:50,302
Useless police don't have a gun.

72
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,632
Catch him!
- Catch me?

73
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:02,978
l swear l'm a police man...
- lf you don't come down, l'll kill you.

74
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,312
Let me see it! Escape!

75
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,417
There!

76
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:11,650
He's jumping over there.

Now also l'm under suspension
for two months only, sir.

85

or taking orders from someone?

89

A-one forest guard.

l'll not let you enter forest alone.

96
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:05,105
He's not trustworthy sir, a drunkard,
l suspect he's Veera's man.

97
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,438
l don't think he knows
anything about the forest.

98
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:12,706
l don't trust this man,
he's short tempered.

99
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:17,612
Half baked man, he doesn't know
anything about forest or anything.

100
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:18,779
l'll slap you.

101
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,615
Slap me? From Tuticorin?

But l don't like you,

00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,297
l'll kill you.

105
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,866
Veera...Veeraiah!

106
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:44,639
Born in Vikramasingapuram.

107
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:50,315
FlR's have been registered in all
police stations of Tirunelveli district.

108
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,820
Totally 63 cases.

00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:55,814
l was specially transferred here
to put a check to him.

110
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:56,917
Good evening sir.

111
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,253
l'm Shankar, DSP,
Ambasamudram circle.

112
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:04,824
Neither l'm here as welcome party
nor to escort you sir.

113
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,566
l know you don't like all that.

114
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,334
l heard many don't like
police in this region,

115
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,504
is it true?

116
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,235
l'm going to stay away
from such people,

117
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:17,746
very far.

118
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,341
Except one man!

119
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,686
He has a nick name here...Ravanan.

120
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:27,354
Ten headed Ravanan.

121
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,622
lf the leader's head rolls,
all the other heads will roll.

122
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:36,355
Shall we aim the leader?

123
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,693
Elder brother Singarasu,
Veera's public face.

124
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:43,369
he presides over the kangaroo courts,

125
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,466
younger brother Chakran,
studied plus 2,

126
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:48,466
to help elder brothers,

127
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:53,882
people responsible for any brutal
attack, ten minutes prior to it,

128
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:59,317
or within 5 minutes after it,
Veera will be there to seek revenge.

129
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:04,549
You know so much,
why have you left him till now?

130
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,728
We were waiting for such
a daring SP.

131
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,796
lf top brass is shivering in fear,
what can we do?

132
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,892
He's protector God to half and
the other half are scared to fight him.

133
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:17,897
According to law,
Veera is an extremist.

134
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,673
Anti-social, terrorist.
That's it.

135
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,641
You've been given this uniform
to protect us from such men.

136
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:27,572
Why are you silent?

137
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,910
Why don't you gun him down?

138
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,753
l got an opportunity
to pin down Ravanan.

139
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,013
l missed it.

140
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,588
But l'll not miss this time.

141
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,493
l'll not come back without
putting an end to Veera's life.

142
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,926
Till then, be brave Ragini.

143
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:46,758
Sir...sir...stop the jeep.
Please...stop...please...

144
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,766
Sir, one minute...
one minute.

145
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:56,675
You don't just see with eyes
in forest, see with your ears too.

146
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,726
Don't search in water, come here.

147
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,758
Who tied you up?

148
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:56,669
Gagged too.
Were you the boatman?

149
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,840
Unable to breath? Can't speak?
Get me some water.

150
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:01,670
You will come...
- What?

151
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,504
You will come and...
- We'll come and...

152
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,679
...will untie me.

153
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,507
He said we'll come to untie him.

154
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,016
What? What?

155
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,448
Tell me...tell me...

156
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:10,447
..if you've sense...

157
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,619
..without wasting time...
- Without wasting time...

158
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,354
On the eastern side...
- On the eastern side...

159
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,786
Come to the hill top of Meghamalai.
- Come to the hill top of Meghamalai.

160
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:21,021
Did you see he tied and gagged him
and told him the place too?

161
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:23,693
Are we searching Veera
or is he taking us to him?

162
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,923
Are you telling the truth?

163
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:25,691
Hill top of Meghamalai.

164
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,529
Sir, he has asked us to come
to the hill top of Meghamalai.

165
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,931
Tell sir about it.

166
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,039
Did you see her?

167
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:36,873
How was she?

168
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:39,037
ls she hurt?

169
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,385
Was she crying?

170
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,197
Leave me...don't come.

171
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,601
Leave me!

172
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,435
Leave me!

173
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,043
No...no...leave me.

174
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:59,786
You'll ruin.
- We'll get ruined and you enjoy life.

175
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,891
Our people's curse will
not spare you.

176
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:04,964
You'll get ruined,
you'll never come good in life.

177
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:11,539
l'm cursing you to get crucified
for your husband's sins.

178
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:01,183
Who are you to kill me?

179
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,085
Who gave you that right?

180
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,689
Why do you pull women
into men's fight?

181
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,206
My life is mine.
lt's mine only.

182
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,875
Will you stop it?
l hate sound.

183
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:26,211
l hear ten voices in my head.

184
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,210
Veera, don't think,
gun her down immediately.

185
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,985
Fire at her!
- l'll not die.

186
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:34,781
My foot! Can't escape fate.

187
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,058
Let your husband,
and this world know it.

188
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,817
You can't kill me.

189
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:43,896
There's commotion in head,
forest cries, ferocious dance,

190
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,730
a question on one side and
an answer on the other side,

191
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,234
philosophy, anger, accusation,
laugh, patience, myriad of emotions.

192
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,008
You can't kill me.

193
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:59,908
lf you die with a smile, next 7 births
you'll take birth with a smile.

194
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,680
l'll not die.

195
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,080
ls it in your hands, 7 births...
- My death is not in your hands.

196
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,852
You silly woman!

197
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:36,667
<i>When did you come into this world?</i>
<i>When did you spark fire in my mind?</i>

198
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:42,407
<i>Teak forest is very large...</i>
<i>A match stick is very small...</i>

199
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:54,795
<i>A falling match stick</i>
<i>is enough to catch fire...</i>

200
00:21:54,996 --> 00:21:57,692
<i>Won't entire teak forest</i>
<i>be reduced to ashes?</i>

201
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:03,303
<i>l lost my life seeing</i>
<i>those shivering lips...</i>

202
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:10,705
<i>l'm going away forlorn...</i>
<i>return back my heart O maiden...</i>

203
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:15,713
<i>Though you're beyond my reach,</i>
<i>come into my arms...</i>

204
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:19,210
Enough, my ears are bursting.

205
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,389
Stop it.

206
00:22:22,324 --> 00:22:23,222
l'm not crying.

207
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,054
Will you stop crying or not?

208
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,729
Stop crying. Come with me.

209
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,234
Find another woman for it,
aren't you ashamed of it?

210
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:38,401
Like a coward,
you abducted a woman.

211
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:42,309
l think all the bad words
were coined for you only.

212
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,412
Excellent Veera!

213
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,748
You've stopped crying, right?

214
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,246
Can tolerate a woman
using bad words,

215
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,847
but can't bear a woman's cries, right?

216
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,420
<i>Sun and moon are coming</i>

<i>There's no fate that can't be defied...</i>

226
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,006
Even sheep won't dare jump,
why did you take the plunge?

227
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,009
Why did you save me like a fool?

228
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:32,449
Even crows won't get body
to feed on.

229
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:34,416
Why did you then try to shoot me?

230
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,614
You were fated to die in my hands.

231
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:39,354
But some fool altered it.

232
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:43,257
Pray, if you trust in God.

233
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,426
You'll die because of me.

234
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,861
That's the destiny of fate.

235

Nobody...what did you say?

236
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,375
Nobody can wipe me out.

Greetings.
- Go...go...

251
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,505
Now l know why didn't shoot her.

252
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,576
l was foolish not to realise it.

253
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,010
With one bullet it would be over,

254
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,677
either me or he would've
gone to jail for few years.

255
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,077
the problem would've been over.

256
00:27:19,654 --> 00:27:21,781
You too would've left her
thinking about future.

257
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:25,417
Why do you think l left her?

258
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:32,030
For 14 hours torture, SP has come
with 5 truck loads of police men.

259
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:37,368
lf we keep him on toes for 14 days,
your idea is great.

260
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:42,635
l was pointing a pistol at her,
a minute or two she would've died,

261
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,470
she was standing fearless
like a dead body.

262
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,307
Not a faint of fear, brother.

263
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,382
How can l kill a fearless woman?

264
00:27:55,857 --> 00:28:01,056
Brother, would you've pulled the
trigger if you were in my place?

265
00:28:04,632 --> 00:28:06,657
l can't think so much.

266
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,565
You want me to cut a goat
and prepare a soup.

267
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,237
lt'll rock you.

268
00:28:11,172 --> 00:28:15,575

l can thrash or send them to jail,

269
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,244
tell me, l'll do it in minutes.

270
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:22,244
Women, fear are beyond me, brother.

271
00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:36,590
She's the new sister.

272
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:41,364
What are you looking at?
Clear out.

273
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,540
You won't get clothes here,
l found a leaf of my size,

274
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:51,109
stitches it and
drape yourself in it.

275
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:55,271
Uncle...
- Clear out kids!

276
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,520
You won't laugh for a joke,
don't fear at a pointed gun,

277
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:03,448
what sort of a life is it?

278
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,120
Food!
Will you atleast respect this?

279
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:15,295
Throw into the dustbin.
Am l a dog?

280
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,296
To tie and feed me.

281
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,465
We are struggling for
generations for a meal only.

282
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,304
So proud? Arrogance of rich.

283
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,537
ls what you're doing good?

284
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:29,315
Women are women.

285
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:34,147
Feeling pity at your plight,
are you arguing with me?

286
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,653
Look, my wife too never
shouted at me.

287
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:41,657
Eat it or if you think
we are enemies, leave it.

288
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,497
As you wish.

289
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:54,764
ls salt okay?
Be loyal to us all your life.

290
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,507
For my size.

291
00:30:56,871 --> 00:30:57,735
That's a pistol.

292
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,905
Yes, it's a gun.

293
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,568
Guiding us to their hideout.

294
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:28,931
You talk to them sir.

295
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,566
Where is Veeraiah?

296
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,568
Where is Veeraiah?

297
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:47,671
Where is Veeraiah?

298
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:40,797
Veeraiah is a great man.
He never speaks loudly, sir.

299
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,065
What's that language?
Great man? Crook, you're wrong, go.

300
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:51,578
He's brave as his name,
he fights like a real warrior.

301
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:54,173
He hacks anyone.

302
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:58,416
These men don't know anything,
he's very kind hearted man,

303
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:00,415
he's lovable than a mother,

304
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,146
he's straightforward and
so gets into trouble easily.

305
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,148
With outsiders too, like with us.

306
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,856
He's a poet, he says anything
in shortest terms.

307
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,600
ls he Thiruvalluvar?

308
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:17,168
Girls swoon over him, sir.

309
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,537
Not for all girls, go now.

310
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:27,110
Not praising him too much,
but he's great in any role,

311
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,946
very good drama actor.
Folk artiste too.

312
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,848
When starts talking,
he'll make you laugh to tears.

313
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,884
Your intestines will burn, go away.

314
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,614
Very dangerous man, sir.

315
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:43,621
A goon, a loafer, hacking people,
womanizer, he does everything.

316
00:34:44,932 --> 00:34:46,866
When he starts playing drums...

317
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,533
He's God of Death in flesh.
Death is inevitable, sir.

318
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:59,645
Enough of it, ten people have told
ten different things and confused us.

319
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,075
l'm feeling giddy.

320
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:15,717
ls it hand? Very hard.
Tough.

321
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,720
Matched horoscopes
and 7 compatibilities,

322
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,962
but failed to check if hands
and legs are soft.

323
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:25,332
Your mother-in-law.

324
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:30,834
My dear dancer,
this is a policeman's hand.

325
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:32,828
Roguish hands.

326
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:38,138
ls it fired or non-fired hands?

327
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:39,804
Touch heart and say.

328
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:43,912
l'll tell my dear.
- Go away.

329
00:36:49,890 --> 00:37:04,100
<i>Oh thief who barged into my eyes...</i>

330
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,765
<i>Will you see with your hands?</i>

331
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:13,777
<i>Will you join me with your eyes...</i>

332
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:18,782
<i>Will you teach me your art?</i>

333
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:24,784
<i>Our silent eyes won't sleep</i>
<i>thinking about me...</i>

334
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:32,057
<i>Do you know my heart?</i>
<i>Will you bless me?</i>

335
00:37:34,402 --> 00:37:39,135
<i>The heaviness keeps growing through</i>
<i>the week it never dissipates...</i>

336
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:45,904
<i>Will you undress and</i>
<i>wear me like an ornament...</i>

337
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:37,192
<i>Will l ever disclose my desires?</i>

338
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:48,765
<i>If you discover my desires</i>
<i>l will acknowledge them with my eyes...</i>

339
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:54,037
<i>Wherever the lips go..</i>
<i>the heart follows..</i>

340
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:58,776
<i>Oh dear...l will ask you to rule me...</i>

341
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:18,430
<i>Tamil knows the parts that</i>
<i>pain and those that don't...</i>

342
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:27,340
<i>Oh dear...</i>
<i>do you know those parts?</i>

343
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,766
l didn't try to escape hearing
Veera's name, l came with you.

344
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,268
Why are you lamenting? Come.

345
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,873
l'm scared...
Goddess Chotanikkarai Amme!

346
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,278
Come out.

347
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,950
Come out...come.
Stand like a man.

348
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,957
l'm innocent.

349
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,017
l swear l'm not responsible for it.

350
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:17,129
l'm innocent.
- Tell the truth.

351
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:21,295
Had a nice journey?

352
00:40:23,604 --> 00:40:24,468
What is this?

353
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,371
Watch?

354
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:31,335
Presented by me?

355
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:37,050
l gave you my sister too.

356
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,384
Where is she now?

357
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,511
Where is she?

358
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,416
l don't know.
- Did you lose her?

359
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,925
Answer him.
- But still wearing the watch?

360
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:54,065
You lost my sister but
keeping the watch safely.

361
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:56,327
Please don't kill me,
l'm innocent.

362
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,300
Where is my sister?
- Trust me.

363
00:40:58,505 --> 00:40:59,563
Singarasu, tell him to spare me.

364
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,431
Veeraiah, l'm telling truth,
l'm innocent.

365
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,622
All of you give poses like real villains,
the photo must scare them.

366
00:41:21,161 --> 00:41:24,187
Don't act smart,
take a photo quickly.

367
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:29,227
Will you take a photo
or shall l take your head?

368
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:31,063
l'll take it.

369
00:41:31,372 --> 00:41:33,602
lf you stand still,
l'll take a photo.

370
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:36,442
One punch, she'll keep quiet.

371
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,140
lt's a scarecrow.

372
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:18,712
Even crows will not get scared of it.

373
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:21,316
Don't take a step further.

374
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,205
Where's the nearest hospital?
- Get the truck here.

375
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:42,500
l want first aid box,
and pain killers.

376
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:49,314
Blood is still bleeding, immediate
hospitalisation can save hand.

377
00:42:51,418 --> 00:42:53,181
Leave us for alone
for few minutes.

378
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:02,622
Aren't you Veera's sister's husband?

379
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,397
He cut my hand, sir.
- Didn't spare brother-in-law too?

380
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,031
He's not a man but beast.

381
00:43:08,235 --> 00:43:09,224
He's a beast.
- ls it?

382
00:43:10,771 --> 00:43:15,037
What's the message by sending
brother-in-law with a hand cut?

383
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:21,441
l can't bear this pain,
take me to the hospital.

384
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:28,655
What's he trying to say with
a scarecrow in sari and you behind it?

385
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,188
What is he trying to say?

386
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:36,193
No...sir...no...

387
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:37,659
Why did he send you?

388
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,331
lt's paining sir...
- Trying to scare me?

389
00:43:42,603 --> 00:43:44,002
Will he cut my hand too?

390
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,253
Where are you?

391
00:44:07,694 --> 00:44:09,753
lf you don't come quickly,
he'll kill me.

392
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:18,063
Are you testing your wife's courage?

393
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:21,071
l'm not brave.

394
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,642
l'm just acting brave.

395
00:44:25,512 --> 00:44:26,604
l'm shouting.

396
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:29,343
Wearing a mask.

397
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:35,316
You're here, aren't you?
You didn't go away, did you?

398
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,589
Answer me.

399
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,225
When will you come?

400
00:44:55,742 --> 00:44:58,472
Madam.

401
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,505
How much ever you may cry,
no God will come to save you.

402
00:45:01,715 --> 00:45:03,478
Your husband will also not come.

403
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:06,378
Rice and onions, have it.

404
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,745
Eat and sleep,
atleast your anger will ease.

405
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,318
You come, she'll eat.

406
00:45:18,765 --> 00:45:19,891
Tape is on, speak.

407
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:21,700
ls it running?
- Speak.

408
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:27,769
SP sir, greetings.

409
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,669
Are you fine, sir?

410
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,407
l expect you're not.

411
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,839
We are not fine because
of officers like you.

412
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,615
l'm Veeraiah, a poor man,
illiterate,

413
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,586
not born like you in high society,
but still l'm your enemy.

414
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:44,848
Villain to you.

415
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,719
Did you see the photo?
Did you recognise her?

416
00:45:50,764 --> 00:45:54,359
l shot the photograph
in day light for you only.

417
00:45:58,272 --> 00:46:00,900
Keep it safely in your purse,
you may not get it again, right?

418
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,205
lf your wife doesn't return,
atleast the photo will be with you.

419
00:46:06,947 --> 00:46:08,471
Why are you getting angry?

420
00:46:11,985 --> 00:46:13,247
ls it paining you now?

421
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:15,716
ls it hurting your heart severely?

422
00:46:20,994 --> 00:46:27,832
For kidnapping your wife,
you wrecked havoc with men and might.

423
00:46:33,507 --> 00:46:37,170
Your women are diamonds and
our women are just stones, right?

424
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:41,748
SP sir, pray to God.

425
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:46,508
That your wife shouldn't face
what my sister had faced.

426
00:46:53,493 --> 00:46:54,687
Be careful with the photo.

427
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,278
lsn't anyone there?

428
00:49:07,761 --> 00:49:08,659
Stop!

429
00:49:10,097 --> 00:49:11,121
Where are you going?

430
00:49:12,432 --> 00:49:15,492
Be a good girl and
sleep silently in one place.

431
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:16,894
Did you hear me?

432
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:49,435
<i>Who is this lady in the forest?</i>

433
00:49:50,737 --> 00:50:00,874
<i>Will she give me rain, or</i>
<i>thunder or just magically vanish?</i>

434
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:07,177
<i>The universe vanished when the girl</i>
<i>with a flower on her head lay down...</i>

435
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:15,057
<i>The open sky gasps looking at hear face...</i>

436
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:26,866
<i>lt is thundering outside and</i>
<i>the wet porch is beckoning...</i>

437
00:50:27,073 --> 00:50:32,670
<i>Who is she?</i>

438
00:50:44,191 --> 00:50:49,993
<i>Lost my life on her lips...</i>

439
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:59,836
<i>Demons inside are hungry</i>
<i>and want you as food...</i>

440
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:39,212
Let me go!

441
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:59,224
Rajakka, come up.
- Veera is here.

442
00:53:03,897 --> 00:53:06,058
Move it...move it...

443
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,238
Faster...

444
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:23,713
lsn't she like our Muthamma
and Guruvamma in this sari?

445
00:53:23,917 --> 00:53:24,576
Yes.

446
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:28,015
Hey Guruvamma...

447
00:53:30,023 --> 00:53:32,423
Send me back or tie me up.

448
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,823
Walk with us in hot sun for few days,
you'll become dark like us.

449
00:53:37,097 --> 00:53:39,156
Veera, see how angrily
she's looking at you.

450
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:42,964
Guruvamma! Why don't you
stay back here only?

451
00:53:43,169 --> 00:53:46,400
Why don't you stay with us?

452
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,673
Why are you leaving silently?

453
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:51,173
Answer me and go.

454
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,176
Will you stay or not?

455
00:53:57,951 --> 00:53:59,179
Where's your gun?

456
00:53:59,786 --> 00:54:02,186
Take it out...shoot me.

457
00:54:04,758 --> 00:54:06,851
That's better than these questions.

458
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:10,688
Okay, l mustn't ask like this.

459
00:54:11,765 --> 00:54:15,223
SP shouldn't have met you,
he shouldn't have married you,

460
00:54:16,269 --> 00:54:17,702
he shouldn't have come here,

461
00:54:18,071 --> 00:54:19,299
he shouldn't have done
what he did here,

462
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:20,833
l shouldn't have kidnapped
you in anger,

463
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:21,939
l shouldn't have thought
of killing you,

464
00:54:22,142 --> 00:54:23,973
you shouldn't have jumped
down from the hill,

465
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,008
l shouldn't have followed you.

466
00:54:26,946 --> 00:54:30,382
When you opened your eyes,
my life shouldn't have come back to me.

467
00:54:32,218 --> 00:54:34,413
Everything has happened,
can't change anything now.

468
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,018
l can't change the path
my heart has taken.

469
00:54:39,225 --> 00:54:41,056
Can't change what l asked you.

470
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:43,418
Will you stay?

471
00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:51,764
Had you not been married?

472
00:54:52,772 --> 00:54:53,932
Would you've stayed with me?

473
00:55:02,282 --> 00:55:03,271
Forest food?

474
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:06,080
Rice and tubers?

475
00:55:08,021 --> 00:55:09,488
Can't arrange for feast.

476
00:55:10,924 --> 00:55:13,415
Make with what's available.
lsn't it, Akash?

477
00:55:14,494 --> 00:55:16,189
You can't leave it behind also,

478
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:21,262
the leftover food may
lead them to us.

479
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:30,502
But Veeraiah knows
every step we take here.

480
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:43,154
A forest bird is taking
messages to Veera.

481
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,886
SP is coming, he's coming
towards east with STF.

482
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:52,130
Anyone of you seen the bird?

483
00:55:55,068 --> 00:55:56,399
Did you see Ranjan?

484
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:00,828
How long it's going on?

485
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:05,401
How many messages
have you sent him?

486
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,171
l didn't get you, sir.

487
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,143
Which side we are coming?
How many in the squad?

488
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:11,311
Sir, l didn't...

489
00:56:14,387 --> 00:56:15,319
Tell me now.

490
00:56:16,923 --> 00:56:19,323
How dare you manhandle
a police lnspector?

491
00:56:22,862 --> 00:56:24,489
Aren't you ashamed to call
yourself a police man?

492
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:25,924
l'll not care even if you're
my senior officer.

493
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:26,996
Don't see.

494
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:32,304
Where is Veera?
- l don't know sir.

495
00:56:37,076 --> 00:56:38,839
Take me to Veeraiah.

496
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:05,535
ln 6 months or a year,
you'll get transferred,

497
00:57:05,905 --> 00:57:07,031
we've to live here only.

498
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,468
My brothers and sisters
have to study here,

499
00:57:10,577 --> 00:57:12,135
who will protect them?

500
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:16,145
He's right sir.
- Will you work for Veera for that?

501
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,577
He too is right.

502
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,528
l know the way but don't know
if Veera will be there or not.

503
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:07,355
Just show us the way,
we'll find Veera.

504
00:58:24,484 --> 00:58:27,180
Check what happened...

505
00:58:30,156 --> 00:58:31,453
The tank is open here.

506
00:58:31,691 --> 00:58:34,455
Move...move...move...

507
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,287
Sugar!

508
00:58:38,965 --> 00:58:40,057
Sugar in diesel tank.

509
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:43,133
ln all three trucks, how could
they do it while on move?

510
00:58:52,345 --> 00:58:53,471
l don't know sir.

511
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,973
Villagers from neighbouring
hamlet, shepherds.

512
00:58:57,183 --> 00:58:58,912
Seeking permission to
cross the camp.

513
01:00:02,415 --> 01:00:04,542
This is SP's tent.

514
01:00:24,437 --> 01:00:25,631
We've a problem here.

515
01:00:26,672 --> 01:00:28,230
They have sabotaged the trucks.

516
01:02:02,502 --> 01:02:04,834
<i>The meat is in the stove...</i>

517
01:02:05,204 --> 01:02:07,468
<i>Pour me a glass of liquor...</i>

518
01:02:07,673 --> 01:02:10,107
<i>The girl looks at you and yearns...</i>

519
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,607
<i>Oh man...</i>
<i>exchange garlands with the bride...</i>

520
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:17,753
What shall l cut?
Tongue or nose?

521
01:02:22,365 --> 01:02:23,832
How about ear?

522
01:02:50,827 --> 01:02:53,557
Catch him...tonsure his head.

523
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:57,258
No brother...
l beg you, please leave me.

524
01:03:01,337 --> 01:03:02,804
Tonsure his head.

525
01:03:08,044 --> 01:03:10,342
Chakkare lost the challenge
with Singanna.

526
01:03:11,481 --> 01:03:14,177
He challenged we can't come
back alive from police camps.

527
01:03:14,384 --> 01:03:16,443
Tonsure!

528
01:03:19,155 --> 01:03:24,092
l saw your SP's tent.

529
01:03:25,161 --> 01:03:28,790
He keeps...a photo.

530
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,392
Not yours but mine.

531
01:03:33,102 --> 01:03:35,400
ln a villain's pose,
like old screen villain MN Nambiar.

532
01:03:36,573 --> 01:03:37,904
Boys!

533
01:03:39,576 --> 01:03:41,601
A demon's photo in SP's tent.

534
01:03:46,182 --> 01:03:47,547
Take him on a donkey.

535
01:03:49,085 --> 01:03:50,052
Catch him!

536
01:04:02,465 --> 01:04:08,131
<i>Chop them if they draw a line...</i>

537
01:04:10,874 --> 01:04:16,278
<i>Break it when they put a fence...</i>

538
01:04:18,047 --> 01:04:22,347
<i>Until yesterday the law was in your</i>
<i>hands from today it will be ours...</i>

539
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:40,232
<i>We were bending down like a bow...</i>

540
01:04:40,436 --> 01:04:42,927
<i>Now we will stand straight</i>
<i>like an arrow...</i>

541
01:04:44,908 --> 01:04:48,469
<i>If they ask for a share of your food,</i>
<i>serve it in plates...</i>

542
01:04:48,678 --> 01:04:52,546
<i>If they ask for a share of your fortune,</i>
<i>roll down their heads...</i>

543
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:56,875
<i>The land will never bow down</i>
<i>to the rules of it's neighbours...</i>

544
01:04:57,086 --> 01:05:00,954
<i>The sky will not listen when the</i>
<i>cloud comes and makes noise...</i>

545
01:05:01,157 --> 01:05:05,287
<i>No one can take away the</i>
<i>land of our ancestors...</i>

546
01:05:38,094 --> 01:05:41,928
<i>We belong to a race that tames</i>
<i>a snake and feed it cow's milk...</i>

547
01:05:42,131 --> 01:05:46,033
<i>Try doing a wrong, and</i>
<i>you will know our other side...</i>

548
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:50,103
<i>We are warriors</i>
<i>born in the jungles...</i>

549
01:05:50,306 --> 01:05:54,140
<i>ln a bull fight, the intestine that</i>
<i>hangs out is our garland of victory...</i>

550
01:05:54,344 --> 01:05:58,610
<i>The only fortune left by</i>
<i>the old man is bravery...</i>

551
01:06:53,436 --> 01:06:57,338
<i>Our air will smell of fried fish...</i>

552
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:02,102
<i>Our stream water will give you</i>
<i>the kick of a country liquor...</i>

553
01:07:02,311 --> 01:07:06,008
<i>A married man will</i>
<i>live a barren life...</i>

554
01:07:06,215 --> 01:07:10,151
<i>A cactus plant does</i>
<i>not require rain...</i>

555
01:07:10,486 --> 01:07:14,354
<i>No one becomes poor</i>
<i>by loosing a penny..</i>

556
01:07:14,557 --> 01:07:18,391
<i>If our pride goes,</i>
<i>you lose everything...</i>

557
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:22,496
<i>Our land is as much</i>
<i>our pride as our women...</i>

558
01:07:22,698 --> 01:07:27,032
<i>If you dig the forest,</i>
<i>even the red sands are our blood...</i>

559
01:08:32,468 --> 01:08:33,457
Look at me!

560
01:08:35,304 --> 01:08:36,498
Can you hear me?

561
01:08:38,808 --> 01:08:39,775
Open your eyes.

562
01:08:52,321 --> 01:08:58,692
Great! You can't escape
but helping him!

563
01:09:00,796 --> 01:09:02,263
What are you planning
to do with him?

564
01:09:02,465 --> 01:09:06,799
We'll send him to hell on a bull.

565
01:09:09,472 --> 01:09:11,497
Won't you see anyone as human?

566
01:09:14,844 --> 01:09:16,641
When will you people
stop taking vengeance?

567
01:09:16,846 --> 01:09:18,711
When will you rich people
stop your atrocities?

568
01:09:27,523 --> 01:09:30,822
You can see only
his uniform and his job.

569
01:09:31,594 --> 01:09:34,392
He has a heart and
good characters.

570
01:09:34,597 --> 01:09:36,827
He loves his mother
and fears her too.

571
01:09:37,433 --> 01:09:38,900
Why are you torturing him?

572
01:09:39,669 --> 01:09:40,863
Kill him instantly.

573
01:09:41,337 --> 01:09:44,500
Kill him...kill him...
shoot him...

574
01:09:44,707 --> 01:09:48,666
Don't think, shoot him.

575
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:52,574
You want to know the reason, right?

576
01:09:54,517 --> 01:09:55,449
Answer her.

577
01:10:00,223 --> 01:10:01,588
A brave man, afraid of mother.

578
01:10:03,626 --> 01:10:05,253
A fool who respects women.

579
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:09,430
What did you with Vennila?
Tell her.

580
01:10:14,804 --> 01:10:15,862
Who is Vennila?

581
01:10:16,806 --> 01:10:18,865
The girl who changed your fate.

582
01:10:22,445 --> 01:10:23,537
Who is Vennila?

583
01:10:23,879 --> 01:10:25,244
lsn't she asking you?

584
01:10:25,648 --> 01:10:26,774
Who is Vennila?

585
01:10:27,483 --> 01:10:28,780
My father's offspring.

586
01:10:31,254 --> 01:10:32,448
But not of my mother.

587
01:10:32,822 --> 01:10:34,551
My father's second wife's daughter.

588
01:10:35,391 --> 01:10:37,484
Clever and brave girl.

589
01:10:38,294 --> 01:10:40,455
The only one who isn't
afraid of Veera.

590
01:10:48,304 --> 01:10:50,329
She fell in love with a boy.

591
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,298
He too is from
a rich family like you.

592
01:11:07,823 --> 01:11:12,692
Veera arranged their marriage
after much pleas and cajoling.

593
01:11:13,529 --> 01:11:16,987
That was the first marriage
in our family.

594
01:11:17,366 --> 01:11:18,833
You know how happy she was?

595
01:11:19,335 --> 01:11:29,438
<i>When lightning struck...</i>
<i>eyes are fluttering...</i>

596
01:11:29,879 --> 01:11:34,839
<i>The sinful mind yearns</i>
<i>for the girl...</i>

597
01:11:35,051 --> 01:11:42,423
<i>The dot on her forehead</i>
<i>has stuck to my heart...</i>

598
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:47,085
Sister! Another sister is here
to put henna.

599
01:12:08,084 --> 01:12:09,711
You look great in sari
and blouse.

600
01:12:09,919 --> 01:12:13,548
You wanted to see the lion,
so here l am.

601
01:12:14,523 --> 01:12:16,650
You came like a coward dancing
as a girl among women.

602
01:12:16,859 --> 01:12:17,757
So you managed.

603
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,087
Had my brothers seen you,
you'll be dead.

604
01:12:20,696 --> 01:12:23,563
l know Judo and Karate,
learnt it in school.

605
01:12:24,433 --> 01:12:27,561
White belt holder,
no man can beat me.

606
01:12:29,472 --> 01:12:30,939
No man can beat you?

607
01:12:36,379 --> 01:12:36,845
What do you say now?

608
01:12:37,046 --> 01:12:39,514
What's this?
Have you gone mad?

609
01:12:40,383 --> 01:12:41,350
You said no man can
dare touch you.

610
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:42,915
Close the door,
someone may see me.

611
01:12:45,855 --> 01:12:47,914
lf your folks see me, l'm dead.

612
01:12:48,124 --> 01:12:49,113
Show your Karate prowess.

613
01:12:49,492 --> 01:12:52,086
Mad girl!
Don't open the door.

614
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:54,791
Why? ls the groom afraid?

615
01:12:56,699 --> 01:12:58,724
She-devil! Listen to me.

616
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:01,095
Shouldn't the world know
that you're a wrestler?

617
01:13:04,407 --> 01:13:05,601
Bloody!

618
01:13:05,941 --> 01:13:07,966
Why are you using bad words?
- Shouldn't l?

619
01:13:08,177 --> 01:13:09,439
Hide!
- Why?

620
01:13:09,645 --> 01:13:11,169
My brother.
- Where?

621
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,174
Hide l say.

622
01:13:12,715 --> 01:13:13,773
Where do you want me to go?

623
01:13:15,851 --> 01:13:17,182
Should your brother come now?

624
01:13:18,988 --> 01:13:19,955
l'm dead.

625
01:13:20,723 --> 01:13:22,122
Open the door.
- Hide l say.

626
01:13:22,491 --> 01:13:24,118
No, l can't open the door now.
- Where's the back door?

627
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:26,550
Who is inside?

628
01:13:26,762 --> 01:13:29,026
Who else will be there?
l and my shadow.

629
01:13:29,432 --> 01:13:32,799
Someone came to apply henna,
l know it.

630
01:13:33,436 --> 01:13:37,395
l'm changing.
- How can you change with henna?

631
01:13:37,606 --> 01:13:39,198
That's him!
- Oh my God!

632
01:13:41,811 --> 01:13:44,405
Brother-in-law!
What are you doing here?

633
01:13:44,613 --> 01:13:46,513
lt's not his fault,
l asked him to come.

634
01:13:46,916 --> 01:13:47,974
He came running here.

635
01:13:48,717 --> 01:13:50,207
l challenged him to dare come here.

636
01:13:51,854 --> 01:13:53,481
So, you've come in skirt
and half sari.

637
01:13:53,689 --> 01:13:55,020
What are you doing among women?

638
01:13:55,758 --> 01:13:57,749
Just like that...
- He held my hand.

639
01:13:58,561 --> 01:13:59,084
Who?

640
01:14:04,533 --> 01:14:06,524
Come down.

641
01:14:07,837 --> 01:14:08,735
Come.

642
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:18,003
With which hand you
held my sister's hand?

643
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:21,242
Don't harm him.

644
01:14:21,617 --> 01:14:23,517
Singarasu brother promised
to buy a bike as dowry.

645
01:14:23,719 --> 01:14:25,186
lt'll be like circus if he rides
bike with one hand.

646
01:14:25,554 --> 01:14:26,816
Should've thought about it earlier?

647
01:14:28,624 --> 01:14:29,249
Which hand?

648
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,984
Which hand?

649
01:14:42,938 --> 01:14:43,996
Open your eyes.

650
01:14:45,674 --> 01:14:46,766
See the watch.

651
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:49,976
Still 48 hours for the marriage.

652
01:14:51,614 --> 01:14:53,673
Till then keep your hand safely
with yourself.

653
01:14:54,183 --> 01:14:56,242
lf not you may have to
tie the knot with one hand.

654
01:14:58,621 --> 01:14:59,144
Go now.

655
01:15:01,557 --> 01:15:02,216
Go!

656
01:15:03,826 --> 01:15:07,728
Tell him, if not l think
he'll stay here only.

657
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:14,268
Coward!

658
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:21,765
Garland the goat!
- 101st man!

659
01:15:32,721 --> 01:15:37,522
<i>The meat is in the stove...</i>
<i>Pour me a glass of liquor...</i>

660
01:15:37,893 --> 01:15:40,191
<i>The girl looks at you and yearns...</i>

661
01:15:40,563 --> 01:15:42,622
<i>Oh man...</i>
<i>exchange garlands with the bride...</i>

662
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:45,026
<i>The decked up girl is red</i>
<i>like an apple...</i>

663
01:15:45,234 --> 01:15:48,203
<i>And the guy is dark like</i>
<i>a blackberry...</i>

664
01:15:48,571 --> 01:15:53,634
<i>Oh girl, first exchange your garland...</i>
<i>And then change your attire...</i>

665
01:16:08,924 --> 01:16:11,722
<i>When you look at her</i>
<i>she seems like Janaki...</i>

666
01:16:11,927 --> 01:16:14,225
<i>But she is of Soorpanaka</i>
<i>descent in the bed...</i>

667
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:40,252
<i>The girl looks small like a lemon</i>
<i>but she is very talkative...</i>

668
01:16:41,624 --> 01:16:42,921
<i>Let's the drums beat...</i>
<i>Let this flower blossom...</i>

669
01:16:47,997 --> 01:16:57,770
<i>As his sisters-in-law hold the</i>
<i>umbrella, the groom arrives...</i>

670
01:16:58,073 --> 01:17:02,772
<i>As her sister-in-law holds</i>
<i>the saree, the bride arrives...</i>

671
01:17:02,978 --> 01:17:06,209
<i>Let the marriage band play...</i>

672
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:44,042
Father told me to seek
your blessings.

673
01:17:46,155 --> 01:17:47,816
No cries and melodrama please.

674
01:17:49,858 --> 01:17:53,988
As if you're great Sivaji Ganesan,
to make every girl cry on seeing brother.

675
01:17:56,699 --> 01:17:57,927
Brother-in-law knows it, right?

676
01:18:00,369 --> 01:18:02,337
Once given goods will
not be taken back.

677
01:18:04,373 --> 01:18:05,169
Brother.

678
01:18:10,312 --> 01:18:11,176
Please come.

679
01:18:26,328 --> 01:18:29,195
People like you're not allowed.

680
01:18:31,266 --> 01:18:33,359
Your kinsman invited us,
we came to bless the couple.

681
01:18:33,736 --> 01:18:34,361
Bless them?

682
01:18:39,074 --> 01:18:45,877
<i>Son-in-law...new son-in-law...</i>
<i>our son-in-law...</i>

683
01:18:49,418 --> 01:18:50,817
Move...give way.

684
01:18:51,019 --> 01:18:54,716
<i>Play the band...clap your hands...</i>
<i>sing and dance...make merry...</i>

685
01:19:02,264 --> 01:19:06,894
l beg you sir, please don't do it.

686
01:19:11,206 --> 01:19:12,400
We beg you sir, spare them.

687
01:19:14,777 --> 01:19:16,244
Leave them sir.

688
01:19:33,962 --> 01:19:35,088
Brother!!

689
01:19:46,308 --> 01:19:48,105
Dev will never shoot without
a valid reason.

690
01:19:52,281 --> 01:19:53,771
l'm sure the mistake
will not be his.

691
01:20:00,155 --> 01:20:01,281
lt was all my mistake.

692
01:20:06,295 --> 01:20:07,785
Eight people were pulling me.

693
01:20:13,168 --> 01:20:15,136
But still l shouldn't have
left Vennila alone.

694
01:20:17,272 --> 01:20:18,364
lt should've struck to my mind.

695
01:20:19,508 --> 01:20:20,873
l should've known it.

696
01:20:23,078 --> 01:20:25,376
l didn't expect her husband will
escape on seeing the police.

697
01:20:34,122 --> 01:20:41,324
The man who's afraid of mother
took my sister to police station.

698
01:20:47,169 --> 01:20:53,404
You can't go out from here till you
tell the whereabouts of your brother.

699
01:21:04,987 --> 01:21:09,185
Will you tell on your own?
l'll not show mercy on girl too.

700
01:21:09,892 --> 01:21:12,190
Open your mouth.
Tell me.

701
01:21:14,396 --> 01:21:19,265
You're a police man, aren't you?
Sniff and find him.

702
01:21:22,905 --> 01:21:24,031
l'll cut it.

703
01:21:24,907 --> 01:21:28,035
He dragged her to the station.
Wasn't it you who took her to station?

704
01:21:28,243 --> 01:21:29,369
You took her, right?

705
01:22:04,346 --> 01:22:05,506
Are you hurt seriously?

706
01:22:07,115 --> 01:22:08,241
Aren't you able to talk?

707
01:22:12,454 --> 01:22:16,356
No problem,
you can't argue with me.

708
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:22,187
l can say anything,
you can't answer me.

709
01:22:26,568 --> 01:22:28,365
Did you see my new husband,
sister-in-law?

710
01:22:30,038 --> 01:22:31,437
He ran away in fear.

711
01:22:33,709 --> 01:22:35,267
He ran away leaving me behind.

712
01:22:37,145 --> 01:22:39,113
Who wants such an husband, brother?

713
01:22:42,084 --> 01:22:43,676
Why did l wish to marry?

714
01:22:46,989 --> 01:22:48,718
l should've remained
unmarried like you.

715
01:22:55,263 --> 01:22:57,356
Who are these police bastards?

716
01:23:02,437 --> 01:23:05,531
Who are they to ruin my life?

717
01:23:12,514 --> 01:23:13,572
l wasn't scared.

718
01:23:20,122 --> 01:23:21,419
Your new husband has run away,

719
01:23:24,593 --> 01:23:27,494
they asked who would l wish to
spend the first night with, brother?

720
01:23:34,036 --> 01:23:36,004
l used all bad words.

721
01:23:37,639 --> 01:23:40,335
l begged them saying it's sin.

722
01:23:43,578 --> 01:23:45,170
l couldn't take it anymore, brother.

723
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:56,780
l thought it was just a dream,
l could go home after waking up.

724
01:23:59,194 --> 01:24:00,525
But they didn't leave me.

725
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:05,196
l shouted...l begged them...

726
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,797
l cried...they didn't leave me.

727
01:24:12,274 --> 01:24:14,435
They avenged me all the night.

728
01:24:16,178 --> 01:24:17,543
Everything is ruined, brother.

729
01:24:19,681 --> 01:24:21,148
Everything is gone.

730
01:24:24,252 --> 01:24:25,549
l am ruined, brother.

731
01:24:59,788 --> 01:25:01,085
Slowly...slowly...

732
01:25:07,395 --> 01:25:11,263
Get a rug.
- Getting it sir.

733
01:26:33,281 --> 01:26:34,578
Nothing...nothing is on.

734
01:26:36,551 --> 01:26:38,576
Nothing...nothing is on.

735
01:26:38,887 --> 01:26:43,187
No hair, no clothes, no honour.
They took everything.

736
01:26:43,391 --> 01:26:47,851
Hemant, you're breathing...
you're talking...

737
01:26:48,296 --> 01:26:50,526
You still have feeling of touch.
Hair will grow again.

738
01:26:50,732 --> 01:26:53,200
You don't worry.
- l asked for a rug.

739
01:26:53,401 --> 01:26:55,198
Are you deaf?
- Bringing it sir.

740
01:26:55,904 --> 01:26:57,303
Can you hear me?

741
01:26:58,974 --> 01:27:03,206
lf we take him to camp and
give a peg he'll regain.

742
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:05,207
Take him

743
01:27:07,315 --> 01:27:10,375
He's in this shape for
few hours of custody.

744
01:27:10,585 --> 01:27:12,883
Madam is with them for 8 days now.
- Stop it l say.

745
01:27:13,421 --> 01:27:14,718
That's what l'm also saying, sir.

746
01:27:14,923 --> 01:27:16,720
Enough sir.
- Take him to base camp.

747
01:27:16,925 --> 01:27:20,224
lf entire battalion goes to forest,
even insects will know.

748
01:27:20,962 --> 01:27:24,557
This will be the result,
he'll take each one of us and kill.

749
01:27:24,866 --> 01:27:26,390
Have you got any other idea?

750
01:27:26,601 --> 01:27:28,228
l do have sir.

751
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:30,895
lf you permit me.

752
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:49,814
Give me courage.

753
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:53,655
Don't let my anger subside.

754
01:27:55,964 --> 01:27:57,693
Only that is protecting me.

755
01:28:00,302 --> 01:28:02,429
Don't let them be affectionate
towards me.

756
01:28:03,305 --> 01:28:04,499
l'm praying you.

757
01:28:05,373 --> 01:28:07,034
Show bad in bad light.

758
01:28:08,576 --> 01:28:09,770
Don't show it as good.

759
01:28:19,587 --> 01:28:21,282
Give me strength to fight.

760
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:23,784
Strength to get angry.

761
01:28:24,826 --> 01:28:26,453
lt's not difficult to you.

762
01:28:42,944 --> 01:28:45,310
Did l disturb your prayers?

763
01:28:50,518 --> 01:28:54,852
What sort of man is he?
Your SP.

764
01:28:55,557 --> 01:28:56,489
ls he a good man?

765
01:28:57,959 --> 01:28:58,926
Very good man?

766
01:29:02,097 --> 01:29:04,657
He's God like man.
Satisfied?

767
01:29:08,837 --> 01:29:12,329
God means...real God?

768
01:29:13,808 --> 01:29:15,070
lncarnation of God?

769
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,772
ls he a flawless man?

770
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:23,408
Even ten heads can't stand
against him, right?

771
01:29:26,721 --> 01:29:28,018
Nobody can dare go near him.

772
01:29:30,024 --> 01:29:32,515
How does he look like?
Fair and tall?

773
01:29:34,462 --> 01:29:35,622
l'm sure he would be handsome.

774
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:38,094
Anyway he's God!
How can he be ugly?

775
01:29:41,569 --> 01:29:44,868
l want to see him.
Once...somehow.

776
01:29:48,176 --> 01:29:50,110
l want to see how God will look like.

777
01:29:51,579 --> 01:29:54,377
l must ask him,
why did he hurry so fast?

778
01:29:58,420 --> 01:29:59,648
ls he affectionate?

779
01:30:02,023 --> 01:30:03,547
Does he laugh and make you laugh?

780
01:30:12,167 --> 01:30:19,903
You...like him?

781
01:30:28,516 --> 01:30:29,813
l'm jealous.

782
01:30:30,952 --> 01:30:35,412
Unable to digest it.

783
01:30:43,865 --> 01:30:45,924
Did your God feel jealous
at anytime?

784
01:30:48,803 --> 01:30:50,430
Only Veeraiah will feel jealous.

785
01:30:53,975 --> 01:30:55,875
l'm a beast..tough guy.

786
01:30:56,711 --> 01:30:58,941
A villager...
belong to deprived class.

787
01:31:01,483 --> 01:31:04,111
l thought l'm no compare
to you, and your God.

788
01:31:07,822 --> 01:31:13,124
But the jealous has made me
greater than you all.

789
01:31:16,764 --> 01:31:19,130
O God! This demon,

790
01:31:19,968 --> 01:31:24,871
has he become greater than mother,
father, desire and everything else?

791
01:32:04,546 --> 01:32:10,007
Madam, l'm a forest guard...
- You'll eat gooseberries, right?

792
01:32:11,619 --> 01:32:14,611
Bite the onion and
gulp the gooseberry.

793
01:32:14,822 --> 01:32:16,517
Enjoy like a feast.

794
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:27,198
SP sir, your husband sent
me to locate you.

795
01:32:28,903 --> 01:32:32,862
l searched the entire forest,
SP's wife is safe,

796
01:32:33,074 --> 01:32:36,043
he gave me something,
l kept it in my pocket.

797
01:32:37,845 --> 01:32:39,210
What's that noise?

798
01:32:45,853 --> 01:32:50,153
Madam...here...up!
Look up!

799
01:32:52,594 --> 01:32:53,561
Trust me.

800
01:32:53,761 --> 01:32:58,630
lf you say yes, l'll carry you
to SP sir on my shoulders.

801
01:33:00,668 --> 01:33:01,726
Why didn't he come?

802
01:33:05,273 --> 01:33:07,070
He's just 5 kms away.

803
01:33:07,609 --> 01:33:10,578
Special team is very large,
very noisy team.

804
01:33:10,778 --> 01:33:12,245
Forest people can hear them.

805
01:33:14,782 --> 01:33:15,806
What are you thinking?

806
01:33:16,017 --> 01:33:18,247
They are tough guys,
brainless fellows.

807
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:22,750
Just say yes, let's cheat them
and escape from here.

808
01:33:22,957 --> 01:33:23,981
Bloody fool!

809
01:33:24,792 --> 01:33:27,590
Don't harm him.
l'm still here only, right?

810
01:33:28,096 --> 01:33:31,156
l'll cut you like a goat,
will you cheat me?

811
01:33:45,813 --> 01:33:50,273
Veera, l can hear funeral band,
l'm hearing sounds that l shouldn't.

812
01:33:50,652 --> 01:33:52,847
l can hear SP's foot sounds,
he's coming.

813
01:33:53,054 --> 01:33:55,215
l'm warning you to be careful.

814
01:33:56,924 --> 01:34:01,361
Yes, l'm SP's man
but l support you.

815
01:34:02,864 --> 01:34:05,628
Did you see them?
Did you see their faces?

816
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,969
They will do anything for you.
They will die for you.

817
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:10,399
Will you do it?

818
01:34:12,674 --> 01:34:15,074
They must.
Because you gave them life.

819
01:34:16,144 --> 01:34:21,810
l'm asking you only one thing,
why are you taking back their lives?

820
01:34:23,351 --> 01:34:27,310
You're the one to die now.
One more bottle and you'll die.

821
01:34:28,923 --> 01:34:31,653
Send back SP's wife,
stop this fight here.

822
01:34:31,859 --> 01:34:33,156
l'll see all the cases are dropped.

823
01:34:34,195 --> 01:34:35,662
lf l don't send her back.

824
01:34:35,863 --> 01:34:39,264
Keep quiet.
Coming back to square one.

825
01:34:39,701 --> 01:34:40,827
Do you want me to say it?

826
01:34:41,035 --> 01:34:42,935
End of you, total destruction,
annihilation.

827
01:34:43,137 --> 01:34:44,104
Everything will be over.

828
01:34:44,305 --> 01:34:46,000
Can't you advice him, elder brother?

829
01:34:46,207 --> 01:34:49,938
He's talking about destruction
and annihilation,

830
01:34:50,144 --> 01:34:51,076
should l get scared?

831
01:34:51,446 --> 01:34:55,075
Are you scared, Azhagu?
l'm shivering.

832
01:34:57,485 --> 01:35:01,182
Are you scared?
- l'm scared.

833
01:35:02,323 --> 01:35:07,090
You scared?
No...nobody here is scared.

834
01:35:07,729 --> 01:35:08,957
What do you want me to do?

835
01:35:09,897 --> 01:35:12,866
lf you hit a silent dog with a stone,
it's bound to bite you.

836
01:35:13,401 --> 01:35:17,701
That tall tree, pull a branch down
and leave, it'll rebound.

837
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:22,706
Are threats new to us?
You've been doing it since ages.

838
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:24,878
They hit us and we fought back.

839
01:35:25,246 --> 01:35:28,113
They raised sticks on us
and we too raised.

840
01:35:28,483 --> 01:35:30,383
Now they picked up guns.

841
01:35:33,755 --> 01:35:37,885
We'll nip their heads.
Got me, Forest?

842
01:35:38,493 --> 01:35:42,224
Veera, l'll not go without SP's wife.

843
01:35:47,101 --> 01:35:48,966
Who said you'll go from here?

844
01:35:50,371 --> 01:35:54,808
Brother, his days are numbered,
give him two more bottles.

845
01:35:55,176 --> 01:35:58,509
Take him to the hill top.
He'll kill himself.

846
01:36:01,916 --> 01:36:06,410
Veera, you're committing
a mistake.

847
01:36:07,555 --> 01:36:10,023
He's not our enemy and
what he says is right.

848
01:36:10,224 --> 01:36:12,920
Do one thing, join them,

849
01:36:13,394 --> 01:36:15,419
wear police uniform,
they'll give you a gun,

850
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:18,758
don't search anywhere,
come straight and kill me.

851
01:36:19,801 --> 01:36:22,269
He's here for a compromise, right?
Why are you refusing it?

852
01:36:23,805 --> 01:36:28,936
Ten trucks of guns and bullets.
Are they here for a compromise?

853
01:36:30,144 --> 01:36:31,270
He's here to check on us.

854
01:36:31,979 --> 01:36:35,039
He's here to know our strength.
- What's our strength?

855
01:36:35,249 --> 01:36:37,547
May l tell?
You're our strength.

856
01:36:38,419 --> 01:36:39,784
Our strength is weakening.

857
01:36:39,987 --> 01:36:42,785
l've been watching you,
you're going overboard.

858
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:45,049
Cool down brother,
l'm asking you also, tell me.

859
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:47,520
Did anything go fine
ever since she came here?

860
01:36:47,929 --> 01:36:48,953
We are going down.

861
01:36:49,163 --> 01:36:51,290
l think this lady will
take us all down.

862
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:55,460
You said 14 hours only
but 14 days have passed.

863
01:36:56,170 --> 01:36:58,798
Watch my words, he'll not leave
her even after 14 years.

864
01:36:59,006 --> 01:37:01,133
Will you stop it or not?
Harping on the same thing.

865
01:37:01,342 --> 01:37:04,869
Beat me...
l'm telling you to beat me.

866
01:37:06,447 --> 01:37:09,382
You've courage to beat me
but can't dare ask him.

867
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,488
You don't do anything,
send me with forest officer.

868
01:37:14,856 --> 01:37:15,823
Don't talk...

869
01:37:23,197 --> 01:37:26,223
Brother, tell him not to go there.

870
01:37:27,268 --> 01:37:31,830
lt's madness to go there.
- lt's wrong to send him alone.

871
01:37:32,039 --> 01:37:35,839
l'll also go with him.
l'll go with him.

872
01:37:36,043 --> 01:37:39,342
No, you may use bad words
that may not go down well,

873
01:37:40,548 --> 01:37:44,006
brother, l'm not a kid,
l've studied plus 2,

874
01:37:44,485 --> 01:37:46,510
l know all the laws
they speak about.

875
01:37:47,054 --> 01:37:51,457
Just for once, trust and send me.
l'll not spoil your name.

876
01:38:34,702 --> 01:38:39,162
Hey l saw...l saw...
where is sir?

877
01:38:40,942 --> 01:38:45,402
l found...went to unreachable
place and met the person.

878
01:38:45,613 --> 01:38:49,913
Give me a medal sir, gold, silver
or bronze, anything will do.

879
01:38:50,117 --> 01:38:50,913
Did you come with Veera?

880
01:38:51,118 --> 01:38:53,245
His brother for a compromise.

881
01:38:53,454 --> 01:38:55,012
But your wife must give the medal.
- Where is his brother?

882
01:38:55,289 --> 01:38:56,085
He's outside.

883
01:38:56,290 --> 01:38:57,917
Where is his brother?
- He's outside.

884
01:38:58,125 --> 01:39:00,184
l've discussed all the
issues clearly.

885
01:39:00,394 --> 01:39:01,918
lf you say yes...it'll be over.

886
01:39:04,966 --> 01:39:06,263
Where's the bottle?

887
01:39:11,639 --> 01:39:13,436
Who is it? Chakkare?

888
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:17,334
Come out bravely.

889
01:39:17,979 --> 01:39:19,105
l'm alone.

890
01:39:23,985 --> 01:39:24,952
l'm alone.

891
01:39:26,253 --> 01:39:26,947
Look!

892
01:39:48,342 --> 01:39:50,310
l've emptied my gun.

893
01:39:52,613 --> 01:39:53,705
Two conditions.

894
01:39:55,182 --> 01:39:59,312
Must withdraw all the cases,
special team must go back.

895
01:40:05,526 --> 01:40:07,153
You're talking tough
like a police man.

896
01:40:07,361 --> 01:40:10,990
Your wife is still with us.
She's still alive.

897
01:40:11,766 --> 01:40:15,759
You're still warning us.
You must be in police force.

898
01:40:16,370 --> 01:40:18,338
l'm here for a compromise.

899
01:40:20,374 --> 01:40:22,001
l too wish that only.

900
01:40:25,813 --> 01:40:28,680
No more fights.

901
01:40:32,186 --> 01:40:38,682
Send Ragini to me,
l'll guaranty your brother's life.

902
01:40:46,567 --> 01:40:48,364
lf you want to talk to me, come out.

903
01:40:52,406 --> 01:40:53,532
l'll be in my tent.

904
01:41:04,285 --> 01:41:06,446
Shall l tell my brother that
you're ready for the compromise?

905
01:41:27,108 --> 01:41:28,837
Shall l tell my brother that
you're ready for the compromise?

906
01:41:37,518 --> 01:41:40,419
This time it's like this only.
Next time l'll not miss it.

907
01:41:42,389 --> 01:41:43,413
Don't run.

908
01:43:23,224 --> 01:43:29,857
<i>This is a no-holds-barred war...</i>

909
01:43:36,403 --> 01:43:43,206
<i>Challenging with blasts all around...</i>

910
01:43:47,915 --> 01:43:49,542
<i>Furious raging battle...</i>

911
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:54,710
<i>When enemy attacks,</i>
<i>take on him with all might...</i>

912
01:43:55,522 --> 01:43:56,819
<i>Win the battle...</i>

913
01:45:40,694 --> 01:45:43,322
lf you step on the bridge,
l can't guaranty for your life.

914
01:45:56,443 --> 01:46:00,846
He's coming...the officer
is coming...if you win...

915
01:46:26,407 --> 01:46:28,875
Where is Ragini?
Where is Ragini?

916
01:46:35,749 --> 01:46:42,655
Where is my sister?
Where is my sister?

917
01:46:42,856 --> 01:46:44,050
Where is my sister?

918
01:46:58,839 --> 01:47:03,003
You can't survive today,
pray to your God.

919
01:47:54,161 --> 01:47:56,629
Come....come....

920
01:47:57,831 --> 01:48:00,629
No gun, no uniform, no troops.

921
01:48:00,834 --> 01:48:02,461
Got caught alone.

922
01:48:08,275 --> 01:48:09,902
Come...come...

923
01:48:44,044 --> 01:48:50,847
Leave my hand.
Leave my hand, die!

924
01:49:35,596 --> 01:49:36,654
Where is he?

925
01:49:37,864 --> 01:49:39,832
What happened?

926
01:49:41,301 --> 01:49:47,900
He's Lord Rama and
l'm 10 headed Ravanan, right?

927
01:49:54,948 --> 01:49:56,245
He's alright, isn't he?

928
01:50:09,062 --> 01:50:10,757
l can't beg more than this.

929
01:50:11,965 --> 01:50:12,932
Answer me.

930
01:50:16,637 --> 01:50:17,365
Tell me.

931
01:50:18,972 --> 01:50:19,597
Hold this.

932
01:50:23,043 --> 01:50:24,271
ls he alive?

933
01:50:31,051 --> 01:50:34,282
Last time l saw him,
he was hale and healthy,

934
01:50:36,990 --> 01:50:40,949
Hanging to the bridge on one hand.

935
01:50:43,830 --> 01:50:47,732
Angry...furious...like a hero.

936
01:50:48,935 --> 01:50:50,027
Hold it tightly.

937
01:50:52,172 --> 01:50:53,639
You may leave it.

938
01:50:54,441 --> 01:50:56,306
Wait, l'll check and tell.

939
01:50:58,211 --> 01:51:04,081
Where are you man?
l'm asking you, right?

940
01:51:08,021 --> 01:51:10,751
You won't believe but he's
crawling up like a snake.

941
01:51:12,959 --> 01:51:14,654
Will you please do me a favour?

942
01:51:14,961 --> 01:51:17,725
Only God grants boons,
l'm a demon.

943
01:51:17,931 --> 01:51:19,159
Don't kill my husband.

944
01:51:19,433 --> 01:51:21,833
lf you come up, only one will survive.

945
01:51:22,035 --> 01:51:23,263
l can leave this rope.

946
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:26,166
Only one will live.
- l can shoot you.

947
01:51:26,373 --> 01:51:27,840
The challenge you made...

948
01:51:31,378 --> 01:51:34,347
Do you think l'll give you
a loaded gun?

949
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,096
l was waiting all these years
who would kill me.

950
01:52:00,907 --> 01:52:01,430
Fire at me.

951
01:52:04,845 --> 01:52:06,210
lf you fire, just ten minutes.

952
01:52:06,913 --> 01:52:09,313
The bad intentions and
thoughts in my heart...

953
01:52:14,488 --> 01:52:16,046
lt'll die along with me.

954
01:52:21,261 --> 01:52:23,456
But if you shoot here,
just a moment,

955
01:52:25,532 --> 01:52:35,237
memories, desires, love, breath,
all will go at a time.

956
01:52:38,779 --> 01:52:39,404
No pain.

957
01:52:43,950 --> 01:52:46,919
Looking at you happily...

958
01:52:48,054 --> 01:52:51,080
With a smile on my face...
l'll die.

959
01:52:56,196 --> 01:52:58,926
lf l stay here...
will you spare his life?

960
01:53:07,307 --> 01:53:08,205
Will you stay?

961
01:53:14,247 --> 01:53:15,271
Really?

962
01:53:36,603 --> 01:53:37,535
What are you doing?

963
01:54:51,578 --> 01:54:54,479
Stub? 14 day old stub?

964
01:54:56,182 --> 01:54:58,207
Shouldn't you've taken me
in 14 minutes?

965
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:08,227
l was scared.

966
01:55:11,932 --> 01:55:17,063
l've come back, Dev.
l'm with you.

967
01:55:25,111 --> 01:55:25,907
Where is he?

968
01:55:29,215 --> 01:55:30,580
Who? Why?

969
01:55:31,117 --> 01:55:33,517
l'm back, right?
What else you want?

970
01:55:38,525 --> 01:55:39,583
Where is he hiding?

971
01:55:42,696 --> 01:55:46,097
Did you come for me or for him?

972
01:55:49,636 --> 01:55:51,604
He escaped hiding
behind a woman.

973
01:55:52,973 --> 01:55:55,601
Forget about him, Dev.
- l'll come back for you.

974
01:56:02,315 --> 01:56:03,339
Let's go home.

975
01:56:10,323 --> 01:56:11,449
Shall we go home?

976
01:56:41,287 --> 01:56:42,185
Did he beat you?

977
01:56:47,761 --> 01:56:48,989
Did he scare you?

978
01:56:51,531 --> 01:56:52,327
No.

979
01:56:59,372 --> 01:57:00,339
Did he touch you?

980
01:57:06,212 --> 01:57:07,679
lf anything had happened...

981
01:57:16,222 --> 01:57:18,087
He kept you in captive
for 14 days.

982
01:57:18,792 --> 01:57:20,623
14 days and 14 nights.

983
01:57:22,796 --> 01:57:24,286
l can understand
what you're asking.

984
01:57:25,231 --> 01:57:27,597
Look at me.
Can't you see it yourself?

985
01:57:33,473 --> 01:57:35,202
Are you ready for
a lie detector test?

986
01:57:36,242 --> 01:57:37,436
Machine will find the lie.

987
01:57:38,745 --> 01:57:40,372
Aren't you ashamed to ask like that?

988
01:57:45,085 --> 01:57:47,315
When you're speaking truth,
why are you scared of a machine?

989
01:57:49,422 --> 01:57:51,549
l somehow managed to hold
my life for 14 days,

990
01:57:52,826 --> 01:57:55,056
but your mean words
are killing me.

991
01:57:56,763 --> 01:57:59,061
Truth sometimes is very mean.

992
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:02,398
What is truth?
How would you know it is truth?

993
01:58:05,605 --> 01:58:06,401
He told me.

994
01:58:09,609 --> 01:58:11,406
Who? What?

995
01:58:14,114 --> 01:58:18,414
My hand is sleazy hand,
but your wife is not chaste.

996
01:58:19,185 --> 01:58:20,413
He said you're not pure.

997
01:58:22,722 --> 01:58:25,589
No...l don't believe it.

998
01:58:27,861 --> 01:58:29,089
He wouldn't have told that.

999
01:58:30,296 --> 01:58:33,265
He told me a lot more things.

1000
01:58:34,734 --> 01:58:36,599
Shall l give all details?
- Stop it.

1001
01:58:37,871 --> 01:58:39,270
Pull the chain, l'll get down.

1002
01:58:40,306 --> 01:58:41,364
Don't threaten me.

1003
01:58:42,876 --> 01:58:44,605
You're literally throwing me out.

1004
01:58:46,713 --> 01:58:48,840
You're lying and l don't like it.

1005
01:58:52,819 --> 01:58:55,185
l'm not lying.
- You're lying.

1006
01:58:58,491 --> 01:58:59,617
Lie is written all over your face.

1007
01:59:01,761 --> 01:59:02,887
Epitome of lies.

1008
01:59:05,632 --> 01:59:06,792
l can see it in your eyes.

1009
01:59:57,584 --> 01:59:58,846
You shouldn't have come back.

1010
01:59:59,719 --> 02:00:02,244
l shouldn't take you
to Veera's hideout.

1011
02:00:02,555 --> 02:00:04,682
But you want to meet him.

1012
02:00:07,694 --> 02:00:09,423
l don't know why you're here.

1013
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:13,593
lf you've revenge in heart,
please go away.

1014
02:00:14,567 --> 02:00:17,798
The respect and affection he has
for you will remain intact.

1015
02:00:19,906 --> 02:00:23,706
Don't know when he'll come
and how long you've to wait.

1016
02:00:24,477 --> 02:00:27,207
l've kept food and water.

1017
02:02:06,414 --> 02:02:07,813
You've come back.

1018
02:02:14,589 --> 02:02:16,318
What did you tell him about me?

1019
02:02:16,924 --> 02:02:21,156
l'm breathless, ears are numbed.
l can't hear anything.

1020
02:02:41,616 --> 02:02:43,345
Am l the weapon to win over him?

1021
02:02:46,988 --> 02:02:48,353
l'm feeling dizzy with happiness.

1022
02:02:51,259 --> 02:02:52,351
Don't get angry on me.

1023
02:02:55,997 --> 02:02:57,294
What did you tell Dev?

1024
02:03:06,073 --> 02:03:08,371
What did you tell him?
Tell me.

1025
02:03:29,330 --> 02:03:32,299
Leave my hand.
Leave my hand...die.

1026
02:03:32,667 --> 02:03:34,225
Left him to die.

1027
02:03:37,538 --> 02:03:39,062
Hold firmly.

1028
02:03:40,708 --> 02:03:42,403
l can kill you for your wife.

1029
02:03:48,950 --> 02:03:53,580
For the same wife's sake
l can spare your life too.

1030
02:03:54,689 --> 02:03:56,589
Leave you or save you?

1031
02:03:56,958 --> 02:03:58,084
Leave you or save you?

1032
02:03:58,292 --> 02:04:02,251
Leave you or save you?
Shall l leave you?

1033
02:04:03,631 --> 02:04:05,496
Did you say anything
bad about me?

1034
02:04:08,469 --> 02:04:10,596
A good wife for a tough man.

1035
02:04:12,373 --> 02:04:13,601
Through the test of fire...

1036
02:04:15,242 --> 02:04:16,539
...pure gold.

1037
02:04:20,481 --> 02:04:31,688
We are sleazy men but never allowed
even wind to touch the pure gold.

1038
02:04:39,166 --> 02:04:40,463
Told him nothing else?

1039
02:04:44,171 --> 02:04:48,369
Go...take her away before
l change my mind.

1040
02:04:55,016 --> 02:04:58,577
Hold on to me...come up.
That's it.

1041
02:05:21,542 --> 02:05:23,737
Veera is happy, why are you sad?

1042
02:05:33,387 --> 02:05:36,015
Held you in captive for
14 days to scare him.

1043
02:05:39,393 --> 02:05:40,519
Just 14 days only?

1044
02:05:44,065 --> 02:05:45,692
Are 14 days so long?

1045
02:05:48,335 --> 02:05:52,533
Didn't feel so much when
l left you blindfolded?

1046
02:05:54,842 --> 02:06:00,041
But why am l so happy
on your coming back?

1047
02:06:11,092 --> 02:06:17,554
Please don't cry.
Stop!

1048
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:20,394
l don't like women crying.

1049
02:06:31,512 --> 02:06:32,501
My life has come alive.

1050
02:06:35,449 --> 02:06:36,416
lt has started breathing.

1051
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:40,243
Dev told me wrong.

1052
02:06:41,856 --> 02:06:43,483
He never listened to me.

1053
02:06:46,794 --> 02:06:48,261
Why did SP speak bad about you?

1054
02:06:52,399 --> 02:06:53,593
Without any reason?

1055
02:06:57,471 --> 02:06:58,495
Suspected me.

1056
02:06:58,739 --> 02:06:59,763
Suspected you?

1057
02:07:02,610 --> 02:07:03,440
SP?

1058
02:07:29,170 --> 02:07:32,298
Great...excellent!
- Dev is not here.

1059
02:07:34,742 --> 02:07:35,800
You're very smart.

1060
02:07:38,179 --> 02:07:39,646
He doesn't know l've come for you.

1061
02:07:40,548 --> 02:07:44,484
You know very well
who can lead you to me.

1062
02:07:46,587 --> 02:07:49,317
Come out. Come...

1063
02:08:24,325 --> 02:08:26,589
l told you l'll come back for you.

1064
02:08:28,762 --> 02:08:32,459
SP! Shoot me.

1065
02:08:33,567 --> 02:08:36,297
Shoot me....shoot me...

1066
02:08:37,571 --> 02:08:38,595
Shoot me!

1067
02:08:40,908 --> 02:08:43,468
Not just one shot, fire ten times.

1068
02:08:43,677 --> 02:08:44,871
Spray hundreds of bullets.

1069
02:08:45,346 --> 02:08:47,541
Shoot me....shoot me...

1070
02:08:50,851 --> 02:08:51,715
Ragini, move aside.

1071
02:08:51,919 --> 02:08:53,716
You can't kill my happiness.

1072
02:08:54,355 --> 02:08:55,219
Move!

1073
02:08:55,422 --> 02:08:56,719
You can't kill.

1074
02:08:58,525 --> 02:08:59,719
Move!

1075
02:09:34,895 --> 02:09:39,594
<i>l'll come back...</i>

1076
02:09:41,302 --> 02:09:45,762
<i>l'll come back again...</i>

1077
02:09:46,907 --> 02:09:57,613
<i>l'll follow you...</i>

1078
02:09:59,420 --> 02:10:05,052
<i>ls life nothing but the</i>
<i>scribbling of an infant..</i>

1079
02:10:05,659 --> 02:10:11,529
<i>ls learning the meaning of it,</i>
<i>the quest of life?</i>

1080
02:10:12,333 --> 02:10:16,895
<i>Life changes when we</i>
<i>understand its meaning...</i>

1081
02:10:18,605 --> 02:10:23,372
<i>The meaning changes</i>
<i>as our life changes...</i>

1082
02:10:24,345 --> 02:10:27,803
<i>A dream still floats in the air...</i>

1083
02:10:30,517 --> 02:10:34,044
<i>And smiling at me as it floats...</i>
