They're pouring petrol.

5
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,129
No, please no...

6

He's a man with characters...

14

Both are in him and
he's different at different times...

15
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:40,578
lf you were born like me...

16
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:42,223

00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:47,409
Who is it? Who is it?

37
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:51,247
Fresh chicken gravy,
want to taste it?

38
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,446
What do you've to do with me?

39
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,451
Who is it?

40
00:07:03,685 --> 00:07:04,811
Who is it?

00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:09,303
l'm not scared of you.

42
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:13,970
Unable to fight like a man,

43
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:17,799
you kidnapped a woman
like me stealthily.

44

With devotion only...

48
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:33,368
There's strength of
my tribe in heart...

49

This is your life's biggest mistake.
- Life is useful...

53
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:45,418
Kidnapping me.

54
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:57,613
She may get drowned.

55
00:07:57,818 --> 00:08:01,872
Nothing will happen, still 14 hours
are there to blow the conch.

56
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:04,779
Let her take three dips.

57
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:33,867
Can't you see it's a police jeep?

58
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:40,867
Why are you waving hands?

59
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:43,862
What happened to your voice?
Get up and open the gate.

60
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,655
Today l really...
- You bull!

61
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,224
Why are you singing without
bothering who is here?

62
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:55,187
Missed the rhythm, boy.

63
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:59,554
Police have come with
a long fleet of jeeps...

64
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:01,240
Bloody drunkard!

65
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:09,614
Go now and come back tomorrow...

66
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:10,982
What's that?

67
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:15,612
Shut your gob and open the gate.
- As you wish.

68
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:21,340
lntelligent don't become great men...

69
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:25,737
Brainless police don't have a gun...

70
00:09:27,106 --> 00:09:28,437
Catch him.
- Try if you can.

71
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,703

love to serve you...

72
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:38,690
lf you don't come down,
l'll come up and shoot you.

73
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:41,696
Let me see it!
Escape!

74
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:43,524
There!

75
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,261
There! Look!

76
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:48,192
He's jumping there!

77
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:32,338
Since 28 years sir.

78
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:35,233
DFO has good words for you.
- Yes sir.

79
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,669
lt seems you've a record
in the department. - yes sir.

80
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:41,932
ln getting highest number
of suspensions. - Now also sir.

81
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:43,227
Just two months,
it'll be over just like that sir.

82
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:46,296
You know this forest very well
or just to booze only.

83
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:52,618
ls all this monkeying because of liquor
or taking orders from someone.

84
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:58,924
You're government servant,
moreover SP,

85
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:02,493
28 encounters, number one
encounter specialist, right sir?

86
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,116
l'm also a government servant,

87
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,320
l'm waiting here for 3 hours

00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:14,312
l'll not let you enter forest alone.

89
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:36,305
He's not trustworthy sir, a drunkard,
l suspect he's Veera's man.

90
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:38,400
l don't think he knows
anything about the forest.

91
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:43,595
l don't trust this man,
he's short tempered.

92
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:47,963
Half baked man, he doesn't know
anything about forest or anything.

93
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,428
1l'll slap you.

94
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:54,829
Slap me? From Guntur district?
l love it. But l don't like you.

95
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:57,121
l'll get rid of you in the forest.

96
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,231
l'll cut you to pieces
if you blabber again.

97
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:00,892
Who do you think l'm?

98
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:14,022
Veera... Veeraiah...
born in Penugonda.

99
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:19,484
FlR's have been registered in all
police stations around the place.

100
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:21,551
Totally 63 cases.

101
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:24,887
l was specially transferred here
to put a check to him.

102
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:33,205
Neither l'm here with a welcome
party nor as your escort.

103
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,310
l know you don't like all that.

104
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:38,736
l heard many don't like
police in this region,

105
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:40,731
is it true?

106
00:12:41,873 --> 00:12:44,274
l'm going to stay away
from such people.

107
00:12:44,475 --> 00:12:45,527
Far away!

108
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,200
Except one man!

109
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:52,526
He has another name here... Ravana.

110
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:55,198
Ten headed Ravana.

111
00:12:56,465 --> 00:13:00,019
lf the eldest is struck,
entire structure will fall.

112
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:03,217
Shall we aim the eldest?

113
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,382
Elder brother Singaraju,
another face of Veera,

114
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:10,253
he presides over the village courts,

115
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:11,890
younger brother Chakri,

116
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:15,384
studied upto lntermediate,
to help elder brothers,

117
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:20,788
people responsible for any brutal
assault ten minutes prior,

118
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:25,711
or within 5 minutes after it,
Veera will be there to seek revenge.

119
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:30,105
You know so much,
why have you left him till now?

120
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:32,840
We were waiting for
such a daring SP.

121
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:36,106
lf top brass is shivering in fear,
what can we do?

122
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:40,272
He's protector God to half and
the other half can't fight him.

123
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:43,775
According to law,
Veera is a criminal.

124
00:13:43,979 --> 00:13:46,444
Extremist... terrorist.
That's it.

125
00:13:46,912 --> 00:13:50,635
You've been given this uniform
to protect us from such men.

126
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:54,638
Why do you keep quiet?
Why don't you shoot him down?

127
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:57,267
l got an opportunity
to catch this Ravana.

128
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,020
l missed it.

129
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:01,199
But this time l'll not spare him.

130
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:04,060
l'll not come back without
putting an end to Veera's life.

131
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:06,255
Till then, be brave Ragini.

132
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:09,929
Sir... sir... please stop the vehicle.

133
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:13,856
SP sir, just a minute.

134
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:21,116
You don't just see with eyes
in forest, see with your ears too.

135
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,757
Don't search in water,
come here.

136
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:13,925
Who tied you up?

137
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:15,755
Gagged too.

138
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:17,193
Speak... were you the boatman?

139
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,027
Unable to breath? Can't speak?
Get me some water.

140
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:22,450
You will come...
- What?

141
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,184
You will come and...

- He said we'll come to untie him.

143
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:30,820
Come on tell me...

144
00:15:31,024 --> 00:15:33,008

- Without wasting time...

145
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:37,079
Come to the Nallamala hills in the east.
- Come to Nallamala hills in the east.

146
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:40,747
He tied him, gagged his mouth
and told him the place also.

147
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:43,076
Are we searching him
or is he taking us to him?

148
00:15:43,285 --> 00:15:44,471
Are you telling the truth?

149
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,734
To Nallamala hill top.
- He wants at Nallamala hill top.

150
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:49,912
Tell everything to sir.

151
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:52,908
Did you see her?

152
00:15:55,173 --> 00:15:56,504
How is she?

153
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:58,491
ls she hurt?

154
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:02,158
Was she crying?

155
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:48,471
l'll not come... leave me.

156
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:50,504
Come.
- Leave me.

157
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:55,533
Leave me.

158
00:16:57,911 --> 00:16:59,065
What are you doing?

159
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:01,409
l'll not come.

160
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,907
Leave me.

161
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:08,869
Taking a child's life,
are you shouting here?

162
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:12,661
l'll break you into pieces.
Bloody woman!

163
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:15,632
We must get ruined but
you must live happily.

164
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:17,456
Our people's curse will not spare you.

165
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:21,058
Look, you'll get ruined,
you'll never come good in life.

166
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,496
l'm cursing you, you must get
crucified for your husband's sins.

167
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:14,427
Who are you to kill me?

168
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:19,954
Who gave you that right?

169
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,626
Why do you pull women
into your men's fight?

170
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:31,782
My life is mine.

171
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:34,723
lt's mine.
- Will you stop it?

172
00:18:34,922 --> 00:18:36,445
l hate sounds.

173
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,286
l hear ten voices in my head.

174
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:42,548
Veera, don't think,
gun her down immediately.

175
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:43,776
l'll not die.

176
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:46,474
My foot! Can't escape fate.

177
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:48,744
Let you, your husband and
the world know.

178
00:18:48,954 --> 00:18:50,277
You can't kill me.

179
00:18:50,481 --> 00:18:52,281
There's commotion in head,

180
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:54,140
forest cries,

181
00:18:54,348 --> 00:18:55,839
ferocious dance,

182
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:57,676
a question on one side and
an answer on the other side,

183
00:18:57,878 --> 00:19:01,867
philosophy, anger, accusation,
laugh, patience, myriad of emotions.

184
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,672
You can't kill me.

185
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,864
lf you die with smile, next 7 births
you'll take birth with a smile.

186
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,292
l'll not die.

187
00:19:12,503 --> 00:19:16,697
lf you get cold, for 7 births...
- My death is not in your hands.

188
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:20,265
You silly woman!

189
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:40,555
When did you come into this world...

190
00:20:40,764 --> 00:20:43,190
You made me lose my sense...

191
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:45,583
Though this Nallamala forest
is very big...

192
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,479
Though a match stick is very small...

193
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,416
lf this match stick lights up...

194
00:21:00,615 --> 00:21:03,175
Won't this Nallamala forest
be reduced to ashes?

195
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:09,210
l lost my life seeing
those shivering lips...

196
00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:15,469
l'm going away forelorn...
return back my heart O maiden...

197
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:19,967
Though you're beyond my reach,
come into my arms...

198
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:24,333
Enough, my ears are bursting.

199
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:26,204
Stop it.

200
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,057
l'm not crying.

201
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:31,559
Will you stop crying or not?

202
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:33,236
Come with me.

203
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,559
Find another woman for it,
aren't you ashamed of it?

204
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:42,727
Like a coward,
you abducted a woman.

205
00:21:43,128 --> 00:21:46,389
l think all the bad words
were coined for you only.

206
00:21:47,228 --> 00:21:48,559
Excellent Veera!

207
00:21:49,222 --> 00:21:50,553
You've stopped crying, right?

208
00:21:50,757 --> 00:21:53,153
Can tolerate a woman
using bad words,

209
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:55,188
but can't bear a woman's cries, right?

210
00:21:55,592 --> 00:21:59,956
Sun and moon are at one place...

211
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,840
lt's true, today darkness too
has shadows...

212
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:28,203
Though l know you're a ball of fire,
l want to feel the heat...

213
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:06,485
This is not new to the old world...

214
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:08,978
Can't stop the faceless restriction...

215
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:11,373
This is a line of law
we created ourselves...

216
00:23:11,581 --> 00:23:15,206
Find number of bones it has...

217
00:23:21,815 --> 00:23:25,794
Even sheep won't dare jump,
why did you take the plunge?

218
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,539
Why did you save me then?

219
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:31,736
Body wouldn't have become
feed to crows too.

220
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:33,526
Why did you then try to shoot me?

221
00:23:33,901 --> 00:23:36,203
You were fated to die in my hands.

222
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,132
But some fool altered it.

223
00:23:38,336 --> 00:23:42,356
Pray, if you trust in God.

224
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:44,370
You'll die because of me.

225
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:46,533
That's the destiny of fate.

226
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:49,994
Nobody... what did you say?

227
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:52,917
Nobody can wipe me out.

228
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:03,781
When sun emerges from clouds,
lotus will bloom...

229
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:08,421
The love that has sprouted in you
doesn't care for anything...

230
00:24:08,787 --> 00:24:13,278
Poor Veera, you can't
find the difference...

231
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:18,241
Though it is sin,
there's no going back...

232
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:23,436
With fires of death engulfing me...
lt's you in my heart and soul...

233
00:24:23,814 --> 00:24:26,776
Though l'm buried,
you'll still be in my heart...

234
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:33,999
Here's come our leader!

235
00:25:43,736 --> 00:25:44,930
Greetings sir.

236
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:47,265
Bless me.
- Bless you son.

237
00:25:58,235 --> 00:26:01,061
Now l know why didn't shoot her.

238
00:26:01,264 --> 00:26:04,229
l was foolish not to realise it.

239
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:06,489
With one bullet it would be over,

240
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:09,751
either me or he would've
gone to jail for few years.

241
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,081
the problem would've been over.

242
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,077
You too would've left her
thinking about future.

243
00:26:15,957 --> 00:26:17,082
Why do you think l left her?

244
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:23,879
For 14 hours torture, SP has come
with 5 truck loads of police men.

245
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:28,910
lf we keep him o toes for 14 days,
your idea is great.

246
00:26:30,782 --> 00:26:31,840
l was standing with
a pistol pointed at her,

247
00:26:32,047 --> 00:26:33,907
a minute or two she would've died,

248
00:26:34,514 --> 00:26:36,236
she was standing fearless
like a dead body.

249
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:38,577
Not a faint of fear, brother.

250
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,232
How can l kill a fearless woman?

251
00:26:46,476 --> 00:26:51,492
Brother, would you've pulled the
trigger if you were in my place?

252
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:56,896
l can't think so much.

253
00:26:57,105 --> 00:26:58,564
You want me to cut a goat
and prepare a soup.

254
00:26:58,765 --> 00:27:00,494
lt'll rock you.

255
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:05,366
lf any boys here misbehave,
l can thrash or send them to jail,

256
00:27:05,568 --> 00:27:06,823
tell me, l'll do it in minutes.

257
00:27:07,729 --> 00:27:11,627
Women, fear are beyond me, brother.

258
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:25,107
She's the new sister.

259
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:28,711
What are you looking at?
Clear out.

260
00:27:32,512 --> 00:27:35,575
You won't get clothes here,
l found a leaf of my size,

261
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:39,503
put stitches to it and
drape yourself in it.

262
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,471
Uncle...
- Clear out kids!

263
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:49,343
You won't laugh for a joke,
don't fear at a pointed gun,

264
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:51,527
what sort of a life is it?

265
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:54,901
Food! Will you atleast respect this?

266
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:00,263
Throw into the dustbin.

267
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,658
Am l a dog?

268
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:05,724
To tie and feed me.

269
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:08,391
We are struggling for
generations for a meal only.

270
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:10,721
So proud? Arrogance of rich.

271
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,490
ls what you're doing good?

272
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:15,491
Women remain women.

273
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:20,247
Feeling pity at your plight,
are you arguing with me?

274
00:28:20,456 --> 00:28:23,391
Look, my wife too never
shouted at me.

275
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,879
lf you're hungry,
eat it or else leave it.

276
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:29,509
As you wish.

277
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,308
ls salt okay?

278
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:40,709
Be loyal to us all your life.

279
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:43,034
For my size.

280
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:40,617
That's a pistol.

281
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,713
Yes, it's gun.

282
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,213
Guiding us to their hideout.

283
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:06,694
Greetings sir.

284
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,559
Our SP is here to talk to you.

285
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,930
You talk to them sir.

286
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:20,823
Where is he?

287
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:23,130
Where is Veeraiah?

288
00:31:24,662 --> 00:31:25,825
Where is Veeraiah?

289
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:16,498
Veeraiah is a great man.
He never speaks loudly sir.

290
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:21,031
What's that language?
Enough of it, go away.

291
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:27,158
He's brave as his name,
he fights like a real warrior.

292
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:30,059
He hacks anyone.

293
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:33,390
These men don't know anything,
he's very kind hearted man,

294
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,388
he's lovable than a mother,

295
00:32:35,593 --> 00:32:38,214
he's straightforward and
so gets into trouble easily.

296
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,724
With outsiders too, like with us.

297
00:32:42,022 --> 00:32:46,644
Very clever, he says anything
in shortest terms.

298
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:52,009
Are you his brother?
- Girls swoon over him, sir.

299
00:32:53,982 --> 00:32:55,714
Not for all girls, go now.

300
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,966
Not praising him too much,
but he's great in donning any role,

301
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:03,545
very good drama actor.
Folk artiste too.

302
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:07,403
When starts talking,
he'll make you laugh to tears.

303
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:08,095
lt's crying.

304
00:33:08,441 --> 00:33:11,306
Very dangerous man, sir.

305
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:14,634
A goon, a loafer, hacking people,
communal clashes,

306
00:33:15,003 --> 00:33:16,905
creating trouble,
he doesn't everything.

307
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:20,103
When he starts playing drums...

308
00:33:24,571 --> 00:33:26,895
He's God of Death in flesh.

309
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:28,293
Death is inevitable, sir.

310
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,954
Enough of it, ten people have told
ten different things and confused us.

311
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:34,094
l'm feeling giddy.

312
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,981
ls it hand? Very hard.
Tough.

313
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:49,982
Matched horoscopes
and 7 compatibilities,

314
00:34:50,225 --> 00:34:52,915
but failed to check if hands
and legs are soft.

315
00:34:53,122 --> 00:34:54,353
Your mother-in-law.

316
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:59,444
My dear, this is a policeman's hand.

317
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,448
Very sharp hands.

318
00:35:02,055 --> 00:35:06,451
ls it fired or non-fired hands?

319
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,005
Touch heart and say.

320
00:35:08,213 --> 00:35:09,912
l'll tell my dear.

321
00:35:10,745 --> 00:35:11,905
Go away.

322
00:35:17,778 --> 00:35:26,262
This is not false...

323
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:35,926
l'm yours in light...

324
00:35:36,304 --> 00:35:44,694
ln the depth of my eyes...
there's magnet to draw you near...

325
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:53,052
Falling for you and your heart,
few more thing made... O my friend...

326
00:35:53,759 --> 00:35:58,688
l've grown thin...
have you forgotten me, my partner...

327
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:04,650
My beauty is glowing and growing...

328
00:36:04,854 --> 00:36:12,647
When my beauty & you unite, it's bliss...
May l become part of you...

329
00:36:53,330 --> 00:37:00,657
Should l've to tell you
my wishes and breath?

330
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:11,609
Should l say only when you ask?
lf l hear in your heart, it's yes from me.

331
00:37:11,818 --> 00:37:20,737
My lips are splitting with unfulfilled
desires, why don't you rule over it?

332
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:30,163
lt's character of Telugu to
row out of romantic seas...

333
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:39,902
Don't you know to convert wild
streams of desires into docile lakes?

334
00:38:06,387 --> 00:38:10,080
l didn't try to escape hearing
Veera's name, l came with you.

335
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:11,852
Why are you lamenting? Come.

336
00:38:12,055 --> 00:38:15,144
l'm scared... Goddess Kali.

337
00:38:19,184 --> 00:38:21,079
Come out.

338
00:38:21,512 --> 00:38:23,984
Come out... come.

339
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:26,144
Stand like a man.

340
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:30,036
l'm innocent.

341
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,840
l swear l'm not responsible for it.

342
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:35,806
l'm innocent.
- Tell the truth.

343
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:40,394
Had a nice journey?

344
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:46,136
What is this? Watch?

345
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:49,997
Presented by me?

346
00:38:53,937 --> 00:38:58,520
l gave you my sister too,
where is she now?

347
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:00,725
Where is she?

348
00:39:00,932 --> 00:39:03,485
l don't know.
- Did you lose her?

349
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:06,012
Answer him.

350
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:07,622
Why are you still wearing the watch?

351
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:11,589
You lost my sister but
keeping the watch safely.

352
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,478
Please don't kill me, l'm innocent.

353
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,486
Where is my sister?
- Trust me.

354
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:16,747
Singanna, tell him to spare me.

355
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:19,716
Veeraiah, l'm telling truth,
l'm innocent.

356
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:36,936
All of give poses like real villains,
the photo must scare them.

357
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,796
Don't act smart,
take a photo quickly.

358
00:39:43,437 --> 00:39:46,892
Will you take a photo or shall l take
your head?- l'll take it.

359
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:49,234
lf you don't move, l'll take a photo.

360
00:39:49,439 --> 00:39:52,492
One punch, she'll keep quiet.

361
00:40:27,813 --> 00:40:29,215
lt's a scarecrow.

362
00:40:30,817 --> 00:40:32,939
Even crows will not get scared of it.

363
00:40:33,415 --> 00:40:35,006
Don't take a step further.

364
00:40:50,602 --> 00:40:51,697
Where's the nearest hospital?

365
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,000
Get the truck here.

366
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,995
l want first aid box, and pain killers.

367
00:40:57,897 --> 00:41:01,920
Blood is still bleeding, immediate
hospitalization can save him.

368
00:41:03,901 --> 00:41:05,690
Leave for alone for few minutes.

369
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:14,686
Aren't you Veera's sister's husband?

370
00:41:14,896 --> 00:41:17,379
He cut my hand sir.
- Didn't spare brother-in-law too?

371
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:19,521
He's not a man but beast.

372
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:21,244
He's a beast.
- ls it?

373
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:26,745
What's the message to send
brother-in-law with a hand cut?

374
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:33,242
l can't bear this pain,
take me to the hospital.

375
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:41,247
What's he trying to say with
a scarecrow in sari and you behind it?

376
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:43,139
What is he trying to say?

377
00:41:43,342 --> 00:41:45,573
No... sir... no...

378
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,302
Why did he send you?

379
00:41:48,511 --> 00:41:50,437
lt's paining sir...

380
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:51,904
Trying to scare me?

381
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,362
Will he cut my hand too?

382
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:15,591
Where are you?

383
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,388
lf you don't come quickly,
he'll kill me.

384
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,683
Are you testing your wife's courage?

385
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:29,812
l'm not brave.

386
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:32,377
l'm just acting brave.

387
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:35,139
l'm shouting.

388
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:37,814
Wearing a mask.

389
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,576
You're here, aren't you?
You didn't go away, did you?

390
00:42:44,116 --> 00:42:45,634
Answer me.

391
00:42:53,775 --> 00:42:55,140
When will you come?

392
00:43:03,073 --> 00:43:08,397
Madam, how much ever you may cry,
no God will come to save you.

393
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,396
Your husband will also not come.

394
00:43:09,601 --> 00:43:13,225
Rice and onions, have it.

395
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:15,451
Eat and sleep,
atleast your anger will ease.

396
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:18,061
You come, she'll eat.

397
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,987
Tape is on, speak.
- ls it running?- Speak.

398
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:32,723
SP sir, greetings.

399
00:43:33,091 --> 00:43:34,280
Are you fine, sir?

400
00:43:34,585 --> 00:43:36,552
l expect you're not.

401
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:41,541
We are not fine because
of officers like you.

402
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:45,014
l'm Veeraiah, poor man,
illiterate man,

403
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:47,045
we are not born in high society,

404
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,942
but still l'm your enemy,

405
00:43:49,142 --> 00:43:50,371
villain to you.

406
00:43:51,012 --> 00:43:52,139
Did you see the photo?

407
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:54,003
Did you recognise her?

408
00:43:55,478 --> 00:43:59,639
l shot the photograph
in day light for you only.

409
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:05,629
Keep it safely in purse,
you'll may not get again, right?

410
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:10,028
lf your wife doesn't return,
atleast the photo will be with you.

411
00:44:10,998 --> 00:44:12,395
Why are you getting angry?

412
00:44:15,965 --> 00:44:17,297
ls it paining your now?

413
00:44:18,035 --> 00:44:19,619
ls it hurting your heart severely?

414
00:44:24,463 --> 00:44:31,289
For kidnapping your wife,
you wreck havoc with men and might.

415
00:44:36,525 --> 00:44:40,386
Your women are diamonds and
our women are just stones, right?

416
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:44,884
SP sir, pray to God,

417
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:49,612
that your wife shouldn't face
what my sister had faced.

418
00:44:55,476 --> 00:44:56,532
Be careful with the photo.

419
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:22,187
lsn't anyone there?

420
00:47:04,144 --> 00:47:07,008
Stop! Where are you going?

421
00:47:07,377 --> 00:47:12,003
Be a good girl and
sleep silently on one place.

422
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,337
Did you hear me?

423
00:47:31,233 --> 00:47:35,326
Forest parrot... forest parrot...

424
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:44,151
What for these cries?

425
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,792
Will it become a drop?
Will it strike like thunder?

426
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:54,780
Will it vanish?

427
00:47:57,589 --> 00:48:02,572
Will it gain strength to fly away?

428
00:48:05,553 --> 00:48:09,911
Fly out of the garden...

429
00:48:11,076 --> 00:48:19,739
Even lightning could make me shiver...

430
00:48:19,944 --> 00:48:23,895
Who is this parrot?

431
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:32,686
Where did this parrot come from?

432
00:48:32,765 --> 00:48:39,222
Creating ripples in heart...

433
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:51,217
My heart is going through
the pangs of separation...

434
00:49:26,976 --> 00:49:29,630
Die!

435
00:50:43,102 --> 00:50:43,928
Rajakka, come up.

436
00:50:44,132 --> 00:50:45,964
Veera is here.

437
00:50:48,901 --> 00:50:52,920
Move it... move it...

438
00:51:06,054 --> 00:51:10,678
lsn't she like our Mangamma
and Guruvamma in this sari?- Yes.

439
00:51:15,486 --> 00:51:17,504
Send me back or tie me up.

440
00:51:17,718 --> 00:51:21,305
lf you walk with us in hot for few days,
you'll become dark like us.

441
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,711
Veera, see how angrily
she's looking at you.

442
00:51:24,909 --> 00:51:28,500
Guruvamma! Why don't you
stay back here only?

443
00:51:29,277 --> 00:51:30,673
Stay with us only.

444
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,776
Why are you leaving silently?
Answer me and go.

445
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,772
Will you stay or not?

446
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:43,432
Where's your gun?

447
00:51:43,803 --> 00:51:46,389
Take it out... shoot me.

448
00:51:48,704 --> 00:51:50,891
That's better than these questions.

449
00:51:51,765 --> 00:51:54,419
Okay, l mustn't ask like this.

450
00:51:55,261 --> 00:51:58,921
SP shouldn't have met you,
he shouldn't have married you,

451
00:51:59,662 --> 00:52:00,882
he shouldn't have come here,

452
00:52:01,256 --> 00:52:02,518
he shouldn't have done
what he did here,

453
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:03,887
l shouldn't have kidnapped
you in anger,

454
00:52:04,256 --> 00:52:05,279
l shouldn't have thought
of killing you,

455
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:06,889
you shouldn't have jumped
down from hill,

456
00:52:07,259 --> 00:52:09,377
l shouldn't have followed you.

457
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,383
When you opened your eyes,
my life shouldn't have come back to me.

458
00:52:14,755 --> 00:52:17,685
Everything has happened,
can't change anything now.

459
00:52:19,155 --> 00:52:21,412
l can't change the path
my heart has taken.

460
00:52:21,617 --> 00:52:23,839
Can't change anything instantly.

461
00:52:24,715 --> 00:52:25,840
Will you stay?

462
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:33,675
Had you not been married?

463
00:52:34,676 --> 00:52:35,834
Would you've stayed with me?

464
00:52:43,137 --> 00:52:44,333
Forest food?

465
00:52:44,772 --> 00:52:46,393
Maize and tubers?

466
00:52:49,405 --> 00:52:51,163
Arrange for feast.

467
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,888
Make with what's available.
lsnit it Akash?

468
00:52:55,465 --> 00:52:57,123
You can't leave it behind also,

469
00:52:57,329 --> 00:53:02,283
the leftover food may
lead them to us.

470
00:53:04,425 --> 00:53:11,293
But Veeraiah knows
every step we take here.

471
00:53:17,557 --> 00:53:23,211
A forest bird is taking
messages to Veera.

472
00:53:24,481 --> 00:53:27,709
SP is coming, he's coming
towards east with a platoon.

473
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:31,704
Anyone of you seen the bird?

474
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,237
Did you see Ranjan?

475
00:53:39,107 --> 00:53:40,270
How long it's going on?

476
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:44,575
How many messages have you sent him?

477
00:53:44,776 --> 00:53:46,032
l didn't get you sir.

478
00:53:46,236 --> 00:53:48,231
Which side we are coming?
How many in the squad?

479
00:53:48,509 --> 00:53:49,799
Sir, l didn't...

480
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,068
Tell me now.

481
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,656
How dare you manhandle
a police lnspector?

482
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,329
Aren't you ashamed to call
yourself a police man?

483
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:04,619
l'll not care even if you're
my senior officer.

484
00:54:08,158 --> 00:54:10,392
Where is Veera?
- l don't know sir.

485
00:54:14,593 --> 00:54:16,282
Take me to Veeraiah.

486
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:42,031
ln 6 months or a year,
you'll get transferred,

487
00:54:42,243 --> 00:54:43,438
we've to live here only.

488
00:54:43,645 --> 00:54:46,105
My brothers and sisters
have to study here,

489
00:54:46,607 --> 00:54:48,199
who will protect them?

490
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:51,897
He's right sir.
- Will you betray the department?

491
00:54:52,106 --> 00:54:53,692
He too is right.

492
00:55:35,951 --> 00:55:37,570
l know the way but don't know
if Veera will be there or not.

493
00:55:37,945 --> 00:55:41,069
Just show us the way,
we'll catch Veera.

494
00:55:59,173 --> 00:56:04,156
Check what happened...
- The tank is open here.

495
00:56:04,368 --> 00:56:07,199
Move... move...

496
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:10,729
Sugar!

497
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,187
Sugar in diesel tank.

498
00:56:12,397 --> 00:56:15,518
ln all three trucks, how could
they do it while on move?

499
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:25,286
l don't know sir.

500
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:28,456
Villagers from neighbouring
hamlet, shepherds.

501
00:56:28,825 --> 00:56:30,812
They use this way to cross the hill.

502
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:33,416
This is SP's tent.

503
00:57:52,242 --> 00:57:53,710
We've a problem here.

504
00:57:54,649 --> 00:57:55,835
They have sabotaged trucks.

505
00:59:26,097 --> 00:59:30,895
The goat treaded into
the wrong path...

506
00:59:31,032 --> 00:59:35,819
lt got trapped...

507
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:46,496
What shall l cut?

508
00:59:47,492 --> 00:59:51,050
Tongue or nose?

509
00:59:52,727 --> 00:59:55,382
How about ear?

510
01:00:20,976 --> 01:00:26,272
Catch him... tonsure his head.
- No brother...

511
01:00:28,137 --> 01:00:30,870
l beg you, please leave me.

512
01:00:31,143 --> 01:00:33,603
Tonsure his head.

513
01:00:38,603 --> 01:00:41,191
Chakri lost the challenge
with Singanna.

514
01:00:41,968 --> 01:00:44,394
He challenged we can't come
back alive from police camps.

515
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:46,534
Tonsure!

516
01:00:49,163 --> 01:00:54,283
l saw your SP's tent.

517
01:00:54,959 --> 01:00:58,785
He keeps... your photo.

518
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:02,349
Not yours but mine.

519
01:01:02,555 --> 01:01:05,277
lna villain's pose,
like old screen villain Rajanala.

520
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,353
Princess!

521
01:01:08,621 --> 01:01:11,175
A demon's photo in SP's tent.

522
01:01:14,314 --> 01:01:16,904
Take him on a donkey.

523
01:01:17,213 --> 01:01:18,373
Catch him!

524
01:01:30,913 --> 01:01:32,372
lf he gets jealousy...

525
01:01:34,909 --> 01:01:36,198
Kill him...

526
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:40,099
lf anyone points at you...

527
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,196
Break his fingers...

528
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:49,922
Till yesterday the law was yours...
From today it's ours...

529
01:02:05,285 --> 01:02:09,878
We were looked down upon,
now we are soaring into skies...

530
01:02:11,088 --> 01:02:14,816
We'll feed a hungry man amply...

531
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:18,814
We'll behead if anyone asks
for share in property...

532
01:02:19,018 --> 01:02:22,745
Will anyone obey the draconian laws?

533
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:26,744
When lightning and thunders strike,
the sky will be shattered...

534
01:02:26,948 --> 01:02:31,242
Who will dare to usurp our lands?

535
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,850
Our clan is merciful on
poisonous snakes too...

536
01:03:06,058 --> 01:03:09,818
We know to punish the
violators by naturally...

537
01:03:10,023 --> 01:03:13,781
We are brave children
of Mother Nature...

538
01:03:13,988 --> 01:03:17,679
Taming raging bulls
are my trophies...

539
01:03:17,886 --> 01:03:22,149
The only property given
by old father is bravery...

540
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:18,182
The air is filled with
scent of fish...

541
01:04:18,392 --> 01:04:22,688
The water here is bridge
of wine to heaven...

542
01:04:22,889 --> 01:04:26,318
We live with nothing but just life...

543
01:04:26,685 --> 01:04:30,380
There's no one break our unity
in any generation...

544
01:04:30,748 --> 01:04:36,304
lf you lose happiness,
you're the poorest of poor...

545
01:04:36,684 --> 01:04:42,232
We'll not change a bit...

546
01:04:42,610 --> 01:05:36,611
The red mud producing crops
is nothing but our blood...

547
01:05:49,507 --> 01:05:50,473
Look at me!

548
01:05:52,012 --> 01:05:53,471
Can you hear me?

549
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,560
Open your eyes.

550
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:14,882
Great! You can't escape
but helping him!

551
01:06:16,629 --> 01:06:17,994
What are you planning to do with him?

552
01:06:18,198 --> 01:06:22,389
We'll send him to hell on a bull.

553
01:06:24,792 --> 01:06:27,117
Won't you see anyone as humans?

554
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,613
When will you people
stop taking vengeance?

555
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:33,873
When will you rich people
stop atrocities?

556
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:45,505
You can see only his
uniform and his job.

557
01:06:45,947 --> 01:06:48,568
He has a heart and good characters.

558
01:06:48,776 --> 01:06:51,006
He loves his mother and fears too.

559
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,365
Why are you torturing him?

560
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:59,738
Kill him instantly.
Kill him... kill him... shoot him...

561
01:06:59,944 --> 01:07:01,873
Don't think, shoot him.

562
01:07:04,802 --> 01:07:06,499
You want to know the reason, right?

563
01:07:07,735 --> 01:07:08,929
Answer her.

564
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,971
A brave afraid of mother.

565
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,321
A man who respects women.

566
01:07:20,428 --> 01:07:22,416
What did you with Vennela?
Tell her.

567
01:07:27,424 --> 01:07:28,588
Who is Vennela?

568
01:07:29,324 --> 01:07:31,586
The girl who changed your fate.

569
01:07:34,586 --> 01:07:35,784
Who is Vennela?

570
01:07:35,992 --> 01:07:37,417
lsn't she asking you?

571
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:39,210
Who is Vennela?

572
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:40,947
My father's progeny.

573
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:44,345
But not of my mother.

574
01:07:44,749 --> 01:07:46,614
My father's second wife's daughter.

575
01:07:47,018 --> 01:07:49,274
Clever and brave girl.

576
01:07:49,716 --> 01:07:51,973
The only one who isn't afraid of Veera.

577
01:07:59,343 --> 01:08:01,605
She fell in love with a boy.

578
01:08:01,843 --> 01:08:03,395
He too is from a rich family like you.

579
01:08:17,938 --> 01:08:23,330
Veera arranged their marriage
after much pleas and cajoling.

580
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:25,498
That was the first marriage
in our family.

581
01:08:25,799 --> 01:08:28,694
You know how happy she was?

582
01:08:28,899 --> 01:08:33,756
When lightning struck...
l was perplexed...

583
01:08:38,756 --> 01:08:43,883
Don't know why l got a bad idea...

584
01:08:44,251 --> 01:08:49,511
lt was a red cloth... .
that struck my heart...

585
01:08:51,613 --> 01:08:55,475
Mother, another sister has
come to apply henna.

586
01:08:55,677 --> 01:08:57,704
Tell her to go in.

587
01:09:01,715 --> 01:09:03,265
lf Veera sees, he'll kill us.

588
01:09:15,737 --> 01:09:17,460
You look great in sari and blouse.

589
01:09:17,668 --> 01:09:19,223
You wanted to see the lion,
so here l am.

590
01:09:19,434 --> 01:09:21,458
That's why l've come to your place.

591
01:09:21,668 --> 01:09:23,895
You came in like a coward dancing
like a girl among women.

592
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:25,158
So you managed to escape.

593
01:09:25,365 --> 01:09:27,595
Had my brothers seen you,
you'll be dead.

594
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:30,887
l know Judo and Karate,
learnt it in school.

595
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:34,820
White belt holder,
no man can beat me.

596
01:09:36,261 --> 01:09:37,815
No man can beat you?

597
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:43,716
What do you say now?

598
01:09:43,927 --> 01:09:46,149
What's this?
Have you gone mad?

599
01:09:46,621 --> 01:09:47,485
You said no man can dare touch you.

600
01:09:47,687 --> 01:09:49,655
Close the door,
someone may see me.

601
01:09:51,916 --> 01:09:53,713
lf your folks see me, l'm dead.

602
01:09:53,917 --> 01:09:55,243
Show your Karate prowess.

603
01:09:55,447 --> 01:09:57,882
Mad girl! Don't open the door.

604
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:01,213
Why? ls the groom afraid?

605
01:10:02,508 --> 01:10:04,342
She-devil! Listen to me.

606
01:10:04,548 --> 01:10:07,100
Shouldn't the world know
that you're a wrestler?

607
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:10,668
Bloody!

608
01:10:10,876 --> 01:10:12,172
Why are you using bad words?

609
01:10:12,377 --> 01:10:14,566
Shouldn't l?
- Hide!- Why?

610
01:10:14,773 --> 01:10:17,290
My brother.
- Where?- Hide l say.

611
01:10:17,501 --> 01:10:19,132
Where do you want me to go?

612
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:22,725
Should your goon brother come now?

613
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:26,794
Open the door.
- Hide l say.

614
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:28,655
No, l can't open the door now.

615
01:10:28,865 --> 01:10:30,388
Where's the back door?
- Who is inside?

616
01:10:30,599 --> 01:10:31,854
Who is inside?
- Who else will be there?

617
01:10:32,227 --> 01:10:33,454
l and my shadow.

618
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:37,184
Someone came to apply henna,
l know it.

619
01:10:37,395 --> 01:10:41,555
l'm changing.
- How can you change with henna?

620
01:10:45,425 --> 01:10:48,147
Brother-in-law!
What are you doing here?

621
01:10:48,354 --> 01:10:50,222
lt's not his fault,
l asked him to come.

622
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:51,784
He came running here.

623
01:10:52,154 --> 01:10:54,121
l challenged him to dare come here.

624
01:10:55,021 --> 01:10:56,645
So, you've come in skirt and half sari.

625
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:58,646
What are you doing among women?

626
01:10:59,016 --> 01:11:01,039
Just like that...
- He held my hand.

627
01:11:01,417 --> 01:11:02,316
Who?

628
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:09,173
Come down.

629
01:11:10,242 --> 01:11:11,108
Come.

630
01:11:18,706 --> 01:11:20,539
With which hand you
held my sister's hand?

631
01:11:22,305 --> 01:11:23,465
Don't harm him.

632
01:11:23,674 --> 01:11:25,395
Singaraju brother promised
to buy a bike as dowry.

633
01:11:25,602 --> 01:11:27,265
lt'll be like circus if he rides
bike with one hand.

634
01:11:27,474 --> 01:11:29,263
Should've thought about it earlier?

635
01:11:30,236 --> 01:11:31,362
Which hand?

636
01:11:32,665 --> 01:11:33,688
Which hand?

637
01:11:44,194 --> 01:11:45,285
Open your eyes.

638
01:11:46,656 --> 01:11:48,021
See the watch.

639
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:51,088
Still 48 hours for the marriage.

640
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,279
Till then keep your hand
safely with yourself.

641
01:11:54,488 --> 01:11:57,280
lf not you may have to
tie the knot with one hand.

642
01:11:58,988 --> 01:11:59,952
Go now.

643
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:02,937
Go!

644
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:08,012
Tell him, if not l think
he'll sleep here only.

645
01:12:13,448 --> 01:12:14,376
Coward!

646
01:12:17,013 --> 01:12:19,068
Garland the goat!

647
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:33,959
The meat broth is boiling...

648
01:12:34,168 --> 01:12:36,394
Let wine run uninterrupted...

649
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:41,089
The lady yearns you,
tie the knot with her...

650
01:12:41,301 --> 01:12:46,849
The girl is red like apple and
the groom is like blackberry...

651
01:12:47,058 --> 01:12:51,514
First exchange the garlands
and then change your sari...

652
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:11,251
She's like Goddess Janaki to look
but Soorpanaka on bed...

653
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:16,173
The crazy boy has fallen
for her deadly charm...

654
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:36,759
The young maiden is like tender
lemon but very talkative...

655
01:13:37,469 --> 01:13:39,829
Let the marriage band play...

656
01:13:40,034 --> 01:13:41,899
Let the girl grow up
into woman...

657
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:53,125
Come girls, brother-in-law is here
to hold umbrellas to brothers-in-law...

658
01:13:53,332 --> 01:13:57,916
The heroine is here as her
sister-in-law holds the sari end...

659
01:13:58,124 --> 01:14:01,018
Let the marriage music play...

660
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:37,829
Father told me to seek
your blessings.

661
01:14:39,235 --> 01:14:41,332
No cries and melodrama please.

662
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,327
As if you're great NTR,
to make every girl cry on seeing you.

663
01:14:49,637 --> 01:14:51,097
Brother-in-law knows it, right?

664
01:14:52,997 --> 01:14:55,655
Once given goods will
not be taken back.

665
01:14:56,764 --> 01:14:57,657
Brother.

666
01:15:02,427 --> 01:15:03,790
Please come.

667
01:15:18,252 --> 01:15:21,079
People like you're not allowed.

668
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,644
Your kinsman invited us,
we came to bless the couple.

669
01:15:24,849 --> 01:15:26,315
Bless them?

670
01:15:30,015 --> 01:15:36,738
Son-in-law... Son-in-law...

671
01:15:38,606 --> 01:15:41,074
Move... give way.

672
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:45,223
Play the band... clap your hands...
sing and dance... make merry...

673
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:57,052
l beg you sir, please don't do it.

674
01:15:59,297 --> 01:16:02,730
We beg you sir, spare them.

675
01:16:07,259 --> 01:16:11,052
Leave them sir.

676
01:16:22,687 --> 01:16:24,045
Brother!

677
01:16:34,509 --> 01:16:36,535
Dev will never shoot without
a valid reason.

678
01:16:40,446 --> 01:16:41,803
l'm sure the mistake will not be his.

679
01:16:47,841 --> 01:16:49,130
lt was all my mistake.

680
01:16:53,701 --> 01:16:55,535
Eight people were pulling me.

681
01:17:00,095 --> 01:17:02,119
But still l shouldn't have
left Vennela alone.

682
01:17:04,131 --> 01:17:05,685
lt should've struck my mind.

683
01:17:06,463 --> 01:17:07,948
l should've known it.

684
01:17:09,697 --> 01:17:12,521
l didn't expect her husband will
escape on seeing the police.

685
01:17:12,825 --> 01:17:16,583
Don't go... don't go...

686
01:17:19,721 --> 01:17:27,775
The man who's afraid of mother
took my sister to police station.

687
01:17:32,683 --> 01:17:39,375
You can't go out from here till you
tell the whereabouts of your brother.

688
01:17:49,839 --> 01:17:51,363
Will you tell on your own?

689
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,031
l'll not show mercy even as a girl.

690
01:17:54,472 --> 01:17:56,956
Open your mouth.
Tell me.

691
01:17:58,703 --> 01:18:04,029
You're a police man, aren't you?
Sniff and find him.

692
01:18:06,959 --> 01:18:08,486
l'll cut it.

693
01:18:08,831 --> 01:18:10,321
He dragged her to the station.

694
01:18:10,527 --> 01:18:11,960
Wasn't it you who took her to station?

695
01:18:12,328 --> 01:18:13,692
You took her, right?

696
01:18:46,608 --> 01:18:48,271
Are you hurt seriously?

697
01:18:48,909 --> 01:18:50,771
Aren't you able to talk?

698
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:58,699
No problem, you can't fight with me.

699
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:03,855
l can say anything,
you can't answer me.

700
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:09,960
Did you see my new husband,
sister-in-law?

701
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,793
He ran away in fear.

702
01:19:14,325 --> 01:19:16,383
He ran away leaving me behind.

703
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:20,392
Who wants such a husband, brother?

704
01:19:22,489 --> 01:19:24,858
Why did l wish to marry?

705
01:19:26,657 --> 01:19:29,311
l should've remained
unmarried like you.

706
01:19:35,453 --> 01:19:37,779
Who are these police bastards?

707
01:19:42,282 --> 01:19:45,368
Who are they to ruin my life?

708
01:19:52,276 --> 01:19:53,676
l wasn't scared.

709
01:19:58,671 --> 01:20:01,231
Your new husband has ran away,

710
01:20:03,401 --> 01:20:06,801
they asked who would l wish to
spend the first night with, brother?

711
01:20:12,464 --> 01:20:14,393
l used all bad words.

712
01:20:16,698 --> 01:20:19,560
l begged them saying it's sin.

713
01:20:21,791 --> 01:20:24,228
l couldn't take it anymore, brother.

714
01:20:29,957 --> 01:20:35,082
l thought it was just a dream,
l could go home after waking up.

715
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:38,711
But they didn't leave me.

716
01:20:40,649 --> 01:20:42,515
l shouted... l begged them...

717
01:20:42,718 --> 01:20:44,407
l cried... they didn't leave me.

718
01:20:49,113 --> 01:20:51,303
They avenged all the night.

719
01:20:52,845 --> 01:20:54,704
Everything is ruined.

720
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:57,802
Everything is gone, brother.

721
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:02,473
l am ruined, brother.

722
01:21:53,584 --> 01:21:55,272
Slowly... slowly...

723
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:02,439
Get a rug.
- Getting it sir.

724
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:06,066
Nothing happened to you.

725
01:23:07,611 --> 01:23:09,662
Nothing... nothing is on.

726
01:23:10,041 --> 01:23:12,235
No hair, no clothes, no honour.

727
01:23:12,442 --> 01:23:13,597
They took everything.

728
01:23:13,972 --> 01:23:18,198
Hemant, you're breathing...
you're talking...

729
01:23:18,404 --> 01:23:20,995
You still have feeling of touch.
Hair will grow again.

730
01:23:21,203 --> 01:23:23,465
You don't worry.
- l asked for a rug.

731
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:25,997
Are you deaf?

732
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,590
Can you hear me?

733
01:23:30,335 --> 01:23:33,261
lf we take him to camp and
give a peg he'll regain.

734
01:23:34,064 --> 01:23:34,855
Hold him.

735
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:35,991
Okay sir.

736
01:23:36,896 --> 01:23:39,553
He's in this shape for
few hours of custody.

737
01:23:39,927 --> 01:23:42,444
Madam is with them for 8 days now.
- Stop it l say.

738
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:43,591
That's what l'm also saying, sir.

739
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:45,549
Enough sir.
- Take him to base camp.

740
01:23:45,924 --> 01:23:49,944
lf entire battalion goes to forest,
even insects will know.

741
01:23:50,361 --> 01:23:53,476
This will be the result,
he'll take each one of us and kill.

742
01:23:53,856 --> 01:23:57,011
Have you got any other idea?
- l do have sir.

743
01:23:57,386 --> 01:23:59,847
lf you permit me.

744
01:24:16,505 --> 01:24:17,904
Give me courage.

745
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:21,329
Don't let me my anger subside.

746
01:24:23,375 --> 01:24:25,164
Only that is protecting me.

747
01:24:27,464 --> 01:24:29,761
Don't let them be affectionate
towards me.

748
01:24:30,204 --> 01:24:31,892
l'm praying you.

749
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,259
Show bad in bad light.

750
01:24:35,326 --> 01:24:36,887
Don't show it as good.

751
01:24:45,857 --> 01:24:47,823
Give me strength to fight.

752
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,414
Strength to get angry.

753
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:52,814
lt's not difficult to you.

754
01:25:08,386 --> 01:25:10,903
Did l disturb your prayers?

755
01:25:15,712 --> 01:25:19,904
What sort of man is he? Your SP.

756
01:25:20,437 --> 01:25:21,739
ls he a good man?

757
01:25:22,774 --> 01:25:24,259
Very good man?

758
01:25:26,805 --> 01:25:29,067
He's God like man.
Satisfied?

759
01:25:29,735 --> 01:25:30,830
One minute.

760
01:25:33,101 --> 01:25:36,792
God means... real God.

761
01:25:38,034 --> 01:25:39,325
lncarnation of God?

762
01:25:40,631 --> 01:25:42,090
ls he flawless man?

763
01:25:43,163 --> 01:25:47,320
Even ten heads can't
stand against him, right?

764
01:25:50,122 --> 01:25:51,990
Nobody can dare go near him.

765
01:25:53,388 --> 01:25:56,152
How does he look like?
Fair and tall?

766
01:25:57,789 --> 01:25:58,846
l'm sure he would be handsome.

767
01:25:59,056 --> 01:26:01,984
Anyway he's God!
How can he be different?

768
01:26:04,683 --> 01:26:05,913
l want to see him.

769
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:08,139
Once... somehow.

770
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:13,311
l want to see how God will look like.

771
01:26:14,015 --> 01:26:16,976
l must ask him,
why did he hurry so fast?

772
01:26:20,645 --> 01:26:22,078
ls he affectionate?

773
01:26:24,141 --> 01:26:25,768
Does he laugh and make you laugh?

774
01:26:34,006 --> 01:26:41,057
You... like him.

775
01:26:49,299 --> 01:26:51,054
l'm jealousy.

776
01:26:51,825 --> 01:26:56,227
Unable to digest it.

777
01:27:00,787 --> 01:27:06,116
Did your God feel jealous at anytime?

778
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:10,686
Only Veeraiah will feel jealous.

779
01:27:13,813 --> 01:27:16,076
l'm beastOtough guy.

780
01:27:16,249 --> 01:27:19,141
A villager...
belong to deprived class.

781
01:27:21,011 --> 01:27:24,204
l thought l'm no compare
to you, and your God.

782
01:27:27,507 --> 01:27:32,769
But the jealous has made me
greater than you all.

783
01:27:35,602 --> 01:27:38,405
O God! This demon,

784
01:27:38,869 --> 01:27:43,801
has it become greater than mother,
father, desire and everything else?

785
01:28:18,417 --> 01:28:24,437
Madam, l'm forest guard...

786
01:28:24,646 --> 01:28:27,111
You'll eat gooseberries, right?

787
01:28:27,944 --> 01:28:30,806
Bite the onion and
gulp the gooseberry.

788
01:28:31,009 --> 01:28:32,771
Take it as a feast.

789
01:28:38,571 --> 01:28:43,868
SP sir, your husband sent
me to locate you.

790
01:28:44,735 --> 01:28:48,857
l searched the entire forest,
SP's wife is safe,

791
01:28:49,064 --> 01:28:52,519
he gave me something,
l kept it in my pocket.

792
01:28:53,364 --> 01:28:54,888
What's that noise?

793
01:29:01,727 --> 01:29:05,683
Madam... here... up!
Look up!

794
01:29:07,394 --> 01:29:08,013
Trust me.

795
01:29:08,556 --> 01:29:13,851
lf you say yes, l'll carry you
to SP sir on my shoulders.

796
01:29:14,984 --> 01:29:16,452
Why didn't he come?

797
01:29:17,052 --> 01:29:21,849
He's just 5 kms away.

798
01:29:22,055 --> 01:29:24,776
Special team is very large,
very noisy team.

799
01:29:24,984 --> 01:29:27,001
Forest people can hear them.

800
01:29:28,649 --> 01:29:29,630
What are you thinking?

801
01:29:29,845 --> 01:29:32,004
They are tough guys, mad fellows.

802
01:29:32,378 --> 01:29:36,039
Just say yes, let's cheat them
and escape from here.

803
01:29:36,414 --> 01:29:37,873
Bloody fool!

804
01:29:38,074 --> 01:29:41,333
Don't harm him.
l'm still here only, right?

805
01:29:41,637 --> 01:29:45,661
l'll cut you like a goat,
will you cheat me?

806
01:29:58,664 --> 01:30:02,920
Veera, l can hear funeral band,
l'm hearing sounds that l shouldn't.

807
01:30:03,293 --> 01:30:05,389
l can hear SP's foot sounds,
he's coming.

808
01:30:05,598 --> 01:30:07,990
l'm warning you to be careful.

809
01:30:09,293 --> 01:30:11,651
l'm SP's man but l support you.

810
01:30:11,854 --> 01:30:15,650
Because you touched my heart.
Did you see them?

811
01:30:15,854 --> 01:30:19,340
Did you see their faces?
They will do anything for you.

812
01:30:19,552 --> 01:30:21,985
They will die for you.
- Will you do it?

813
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:24,571
They must.

814
01:30:24,783 --> 01:30:27,375
Because you did so much to them.

815
01:30:27,584 --> 01:30:33,240
l'm asking you only one thing,
why are you taking back their lives?

816
01:30:34,282 --> 01:30:35,940
You're the one to die now.

817
01:30:36,312 --> 01:30:38,573
One more bottle and you'll die.

818
01:30:38,776 --> 01:30:41,971
Send back SP's wife,
stop this fight here.

819
01:30:42,341 --> 01:30:44,303
l'll see all the cases are dropped.

820
01:30:44,504 --> 01:30:46,233
lf l don't send her back.

821
01:30:46,439 --> 01:30:49,667
Keep quiet.
Coming back to square one.

822
01:30:49,873 --> 01:30:50,895
Do you want me to say it?

823
01:30:51,274 --> 01:30:52,929
End of you, total destruction,
annihilation.

824
01:30:53,303 --> 01:30:54,292
Everything will be over.

825
01:30:54,504 --> 01:30:55,963
Can't you advice him, elder brother?

826
01:30:56,334 --> 01:30:59,888
He's talking about destruction
and annihilation,

827
01:31:00,265 --> 01:31:01,528
should l get scared?

828
01:31:01,734 --> 01:31:05,665
Are you scared, Rangaiah?
l'm shivering.

829
01:31:06,995 --> 01:31:09,360
Are you scared?

830
01:31:10,191 --> 01:31:12,787
You scared?

831
01:31:14,591 --> 01:31:16,559
No... nobody here is scared.

832
01:31:16,759 --> 01:31:18,153
What do you want me to do?

833
01:31:18,626 --> 01:31:21,952
lf you hit a silent dog with a stone,
it's bound to bite you.

834
01:31:22,321 --> 01:31:27,217
That tall tree, pull a branch down
and leave, it'll rebound.

835
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,345
Are threats new to us?

836
01:31:29,552 --> 01:31:30,949
You've been doing it since long.

837
01:31:31,318 --> 01:31:33,471
They hit us and we fought back.

838
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:36,580
They raised sticks on us
and we too raised.

839
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:38,801
Now they picked up guns.

840
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:43,241
We'll nip their heads.

841
01:31:43,545 --> 01:31:45,736
Got me?

842
01:31:46,374 --> 01:31:50,809
Veera, l'll not go without SP's wife.

843
01:31:54,307 --> 01:31:56,666
Who said you'll go from here?

844
01:31:57,638 --> 01:32:02,092
Brother, his days are numbered,
give him two more bottles.

845
01:32:02,305 --> 01:32:06,126
Take him to the hill top.
He'll kill himself.

846
01:32:08,765 --> 01:32:13,691
Veera, you're committing a mistake.

847
01:32:14,126 --> 01:32:16,722
He's not our enemy and
what he says is right.

848
01:32:17,089 --> 01:32:19,648
Do one thing, join them,

849
01:32:19,862 --> 01:32:22,119
wear uniform,
they'll give you a gun,

850
01:32:22,323 --> 01:32:25,342
don't search anywhere,
come straight here and kill me.

851
01:32:25,723 --> 01:32:26,745
He's here for a compromise, right?

852
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:28,608
Why are you refusing it?

853
01:32:29,552 --> 01:32:33,039
Tem trucks of gun and bullets.

854
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:34,719
Are they here for a compromise?

855
01:32:35,647 --> 01:32:37,113
He's here to check on us.

856
01:32:37,315 --> 01:32:40,438
He's here to know our strength.
- What's our strength?

857
01:32:40,645 --> 01:32:43,108
May l tell? You're our strength.

858
01:32:43,543 --> 01:32:45,443
Our strength is weakening.

859
01:32:45,646 --> 01:32:47,703
l've been watching you,
you're going overboard.

860
01:32:48,074 --> 01:32:50,061
Cool down brother,
l'm asking you also, tell me.

861
01:32:50,272 --> 01:32:52,331
Did anything go fine
ever since she came here?

862
01:32:52,541 --> 01:32:53,632
We are going down.

863
01:32:54,009 --> 01:32:56,701
l think this lady will
take us all down.

864
01:32:57,241 --> 01:33:00,465
You said 14 hours only
but 14 days have passed.

865
01:33:00,671 --> 01:33:03,428
Watch my words, he'll not leave
her even after 14 years.

866
01:33:03,636 --> 01:33:05,398
Will you stop it or not?
Harping on the same thing

867
01:33:05,604 --> 01:33:09,396
Leave me...
- l'm telling you to beat me.

868
01:33:10,595 --> 01:33:13,687
You've courage to beat me
but can't dare ask him.

869
01:33:16,332 --> 01:33:19,192
You don't do anything,
send me with forest officer.

870
01:33:26,992 --> 01:33:30,080
Brother, tell him not to go there.

871
01:33:30,489 --> 01:33:31,457
lt's madness to go there.

872
01:33:31,658 --> 01:33:36,606
lt's wrong to send him alone.
l'll also go with him.

873
01:33:37,919 --> 01:33:38,385
l'll go with him.

874
01:33:38,586 --> 01:33:42,278
No, you may use bad words
that may not go down well,

875
01:33:43,211 --> 01:33:46,541
brother, l'm not a kid,
l've done intermediate,

876
01:33:46,912 --> 01:33:49,105
l know all the laws they speak about.

877
01:33:49,312 --> 01:33:52,367
Just for once, trust and send me.

878
01:33:52,578 --> 01:33:54,098
l'll not spoil your name.

879
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:39,349
Hey l saw... l saw... where is sir?

880
01:34:39,916 --> 01:34:44,008
l found... went to unreachable
place and met the person.

881
01:34:44,216 --> 01:34:49,549
Give me a medal sir, gold, silver
or bronze, anything will do.

882
01:34:49,919 --> 01:34:51,937
What did you bring with you?
- His brother for a compromise.

883
01:34:52,147 --> 01:34:54,574
But your wife must give the medal.
- Where is his brother?

884
01:34:54,943 --> 01:34:55,340
He's outside.

885
01:34:55,543 --> 01:34:57,268
Where is his brother?
- He's outside.

886
01:34:57,473 --> 01:34:59,271
l've discussed all the issues.

887
01:34:59,476 --> 01:35:01,494
lf you say yes...

888
01:35:05,305 --> 01:35:07,398
Where's the bottle?

889
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:12,494
Who is it? Chakri?

890
01:35:14,836 --> 01:35:16,195
Come out bravely.

891
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,092
No need to fear.

892
01:35:22,032 --> 01:35:23,491
l'm alone.

893
01:35:24,301 --> 01:35:25,318
Look!

894
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:47,845
l've emptied my gun.

895
01:35:49,753 --> 01:35:51,181
Two conditions.

896
01:35:52,082 --> 01:35:56,877
Must withdraw all the cases,
special team must go back.

897
01:36:02,077 --> 01:36:03,442
You're speaking like a police man.

898
01:36:03,813 --> 01:36:07,902
Your wife is still with us.
She's still alive.

899
01:36:08,111 --> 01:36:10,437
You're still warning us.

900
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:12,166
You must be in police force.

901
01:36:12,369 --> 01:36:16,062
l'm here for a compromise.

902
01:36:16,266 --> 01:36:18,396
l too wish that only.

903
01:36:21,368 --> 01:36:25,300
No more fights, no more deaths.

904
01:36:27,327 --> 01:36:33,981
Send Ragini to me,
l'll guaranty your brother's life.

905
01:36:41,122 --> 01:36:43,178
lf you want to talk to me, come out.

906
01:36:46,853 --> 01:36:48,316
l'll be in my tent.

907
01:36:58,214 --> 01:37:00,649
Shall l tell my brother that
you're ready for the compromise?

908
01:37:20,002 --> 01:37:22,198
Shall l tell my brother that
you're ready for the compromise?

909
01:37:29,668 --> 01:37:31,752
This time it's just a scratch.

910
01:37:32,095 --> 01:37:35,892
Next time l'll not miss it.

911
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:59,116
Don't run.

912
01:39:11,412 --> 01:39:14,098
This is a no-holds-barred war...

913
01:39:14,472 --> 01:39:18,095
Challenging with blasts all around...

914
01:39:35,034 --> 01:39:36,431
Furious raging battle...

915
01:39:36,635 --> 01:39:41,756
When enemy attacks,
take on him with all might...

916
01:39:42,429 --> 01:39:45,551
Win the battle...

917
01:41:22,847 --> 01:41:25,808
lf you step on the bridge,
l can't guaranty for your life.

918
01:41:35,774 --> 01:41:42,396
He's coming... the officer is
coming on two legs...

919
01:41:42,603 --> 01:41:44,399
He has come.

920
01:41:52,693 --> 01:41:53,888
lf you win...

921
01:42:06,695 --> 01:42:07,676
Where is Ragini?

922
01:42:07,887 --> 01:42:09,350
Where is Ragini?

923
01:42:09,691 --> 01:42:11,208
Where is Ragini?

924
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:13,785
Where is Vennela?

925
01:42:15,583 --> 01:42:17,450
Where is my sister?

926
01:42:19,316 --> 01:42:20,716
Where is my sister?

927
01:42:20,953 --> 01:42:22,434
Where is my sister?

928
01:42:37,906 --> 01:42:41,804
You can't survive today,
pray to your God.

929
01:43:30,746 --> 01:43:33,174
Come... . come... .

930
01:43:34,111 --> 01:43:37,133
No gun, no uniform, no troops.

931
01:43:37,344 --> 01:43:39,710
Got caught alone.

932
01:43:44,373 --> 01:43:46,034
Come... come...

933
01:44:18,722 --> 01:44:20,582
Leave my hand.

934
01:44:21,187 --> 01:44:25,083
Leave my hand, die!

935
01:45:07,997 --> 01:45:09,050
Where is he?

936
01:45:09,995 --> 01:45:11,929
What happened?

937
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:19,979
He's Lord Rama and
l'm 10 headed Ravana, right?

938
01:45:26,456 --> 01:45:28,006
He's alright, isn't he?

939
01:45:39,845 --> 01:45:41,505
l can't beg more than this.

940
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:44,971
Answer me.

941
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,168
Tell me.

942
01:45:48,910 --> 01:45:49,965
Hold this.

943
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:54,501
ls he alive?

944
01:46:00,937 --> 01:46:04,389
Last time l saw him,
he was hale and healthy,

945
01:46:06,466 --> 01:46:10,953
Hanging to the bridge on one hand.

946
01:46:13,327 --> 01:46:17,155
Angrily... furiously... like a hero.

947
01:46:18,061 --> 01:46:19,493
Hold it tightly.

948
01:46:21,326 --> 01:46:23,055
You may leave it.

949
01:46:23,494 --> 01:46:25,318
Wait, l'll check and tell.

950
01:46:25,524 --> 01:46:28,144
Where are you man?

951
01:46:28,355 --> 01:46:32,978
Are you there, SP?

952
01:46:36,283 --> 01:46:39,406
You won't believe but he's
crawling up like a snake.

953
01:46:40,983 --> 01:46:42,740
Will you please do me a favour?

954
01:46:42,948 --> 01:46:45,346
Only God grants boons, l'm a demon.

955
01:46:45,711 --> 01:46:47,076
Don't kill my husband.

956
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:49,261
lf you come up, only one will survive.

957
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:52,467
l can leave this rope.
- Only one will live.

958
01:46:52,839 --> 01:46:55,397
l can shoot you.
- lf you...

959
01:46:58,806 --> 01:47:01,963
Do you think l'll give you a loaded gun?

960
01:47:20,727 --> 01:47:24,713
l was waiting all these years
who would kill me.

961
01:47:26,927 --> 01:47:28,046
Fire at me.

962
01:47:30,792 --> 01:47:32,913
lf you fire, just ten minutes.

963
01:47:33,122 --> 01:47:36,313
The bad intentions and
thoughts in my heart...

964
01:47:40,019 --> 01:47:41,817
lt'll die along with me.

965
01:47:46,613 --> 01:47:49,081
But if you shoot here, just a moment,

966
01:47:51,611 --> 01:48:00,129
memories, desires, love, breath,
all will go at a time.

967
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:04,293
No pain.

968
01:48:08,103 --> 01:48:11,294
Looking at you happily...

969
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:15,290
with a smile on my face...
l'll die.

970
01:48:20,062 --> 01:48:23,125
lf l stay here...
will you spare his life?

971
01:48:30,694 --> 01:48:31,713
Will you stay?

972
01:48:37,323 --> 01:48:38,479
Really?

973
01:49:00,113 --> 01:49:01,199
What's this?

974
01:50:10,708 --> 01:50:13,670
14 days?

975
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:16,997
You said you'll take me
in 14 minutes.

976
01:50:25,670 --> 01:50:26,720
l was scared.

977
01:50:29,929 --> 01:50:31,158
l've come back, Dev.

978
01:50:42,455 --> 01:50:43,551
Where is he?

979
01:50:46,422 --> 01:50:49,509
Who? Why?
l'm back, right?

980
01:50:49,718 --> 01:50:51,344
What else you want?

981
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:56,905
Look at me.
- Where is he hiding?

982
01:50:59,487 --> 01:51:03,345
Did you come for me or for him?

983
01:51:05,911 --> 01:51:08,468
He escaped hiding behind a woman.

984
01:51:08,944 --> 01:51:10,409
Forget about him, Dev.

985
01:51:10,608 --> 01:51:12,473
l'll come back for you.

986
01:51:18,374 --> 01:51:19,460
Let's go home.

987
01:51:25,864 --> 01:51:27,061
Let's go home.

988
01:51:55,518 --> 01:51:56,489
Did he beat you?

989
01:52:01,684 --> 01:52:02,872
Did he scare you?

990
01:52:05,382 --> 01:52:06,241
No.

991
01:52:12,877 --> 01:52:13,961
Did he touch you?

992
01:52:19,542 --> 01:52:21,299
lf anything had happened...

993
01:52:28,939 --> 01:52:31,230
He kept you in captive for 14 days.

994
01:52:31,566 --> 01:52:33,722
14 days and 14 nights.

995
01:52:35,263 --> 01:52:37,229
l can understand what you're asking.

996
01:52:37,497 --> 01:52:38,724
Look at me.

997
01:52:38,964 --> 01:52:40,552
Can't you see it yourself?

998
01:52:45,193 --> 01:52:47,355
Are you ready for a lie detector test?

999
01:52:48,189 --> 01:52:49,712
Machine will find the lie.

1000
01:52:50,594 --> 01:52:52,351
Aren't you ashamed to ask like that?

1001
01:52:56,552 --> 01:52:59,278
When you're saying truth,
why are you scared of a machine?

1002
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:03,375
l somehow managed to hold
my life for 14 days,

1003
01:53:03,916 --> 01:53:06,541
but your mean words are killing me.

1004
01:53:07,883 --> 01:53:10,344
Truth sometimes is very mean.

1005
01:53:10,881 --> 01:53:14,140
What is truth?
How would you know it is truth?

1006
01:53:16,279 --> 01:53:17,536
He told me.

1007
01:53:20,246 --> 01:53:22,210
Who? What?

1008
01:53:24,405 --> 01:53:28,841
My hand is holding your hand,
but your wife is not chaste.

1009
01:53:29,203 --> 01:53:30,864
He said not pure.

1010
01:53:32,773 --> 01:53:35,795
No... l don't believe it.

1011
01:53:37,567 --> 01:53:39,054
He wouldn't told that.

1012
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:43,222
He told me a lot more things.

1013
01:53:44,329 --> 01:53:46,123
Shall l say it in details?
- Stop it.

1014
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:48,787
Pull the chain, l'll get down.

1015
01:53:49,429 --> 01:53:50,690
Don't threaten me.

1016
01:53:52,191 --> 01:53:54,182
You're literally throwing me out.

1017
01:53:55,587 --> 01:53:58,387
You're lying and l don't like it.

1018
01:54:01,489 --> 01:54:04,215
l'm not lying.
- You're lying.

1019
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:08,548
Lie is written all over your face.

1020
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:11,548
Epitome of lies.

1021
01:54:13,578 --> 01:54:15,207
l can see it in your eyes.

1022
01:55:03,558 --> 01:55:05,353
You shouldn't have come back.

1023
01:55:05,757 --> 01:55:08,619
l shouldn't take you
to Veera's hideout.

1024
01:55:08,988 --> 01:55:11,007
But you want to meet him.

1025
01:55:12,521 --> 01:55:14,449
l don't know why you're here.

1026
01:55:14,717 --> 01:55:19,339
lf you've revenge in heart,
please go away.

1027
01:55:19,984 --> 01:55:23,434
The respect he has for you
will remain intact.

1028
01:55:24,975 --> 01:55:28,668
Don't know when he'll come and
how long you've to wait.

1029
01:55:29,243 --> 01:55:32,067
l've kept food and water.

1030
01:57:08,388 --> 01:57:09,881
You've come back.

1031
01:57:16,184 --> 01:57:17,814
What did you tell him about me?

1032
01:57:18,022 --> 01:57:20,348
l'm breathless,
l can't hear anything.

1033
01:57:20,554 --> 01:57:22,945
My ears are numbed.

1034
01:57:42,012 --> 01:57:44,064
Am l the weapon to win over him?

1035
01:57:46,936 --> 01:57:48,869
l'm feeling dizzy with happiness.

1036
01:57:51,103 --> 01:57:52,400
Don't get angry on me.

1037
01:57:55,732 --> 01:57:57,288
What did you tell Dev?

1038
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:06,786
What did you tell him?

1039
01:58:06,997 --> 01:58:07,792
Tell me.

1040
01:58:23,918 --> 01:58:26,643
Veera, leave my hand.

1041
01:58:27,684 --> 01:58:30,646
Leave my hand... let me die.

1042
01:58:30,881 --> 01:58:32,778
He said let me die.

1043
01:58:35,613 --> 01:58:40,309
Hold tightly,
l can kill you for your wife.

1044
01:58:46,372 --> 01:58:51,236
For the same wife's sake
l can spare your life.

1045
01:58:52,072 --> 01:58:53,931
Leave you or save you?

1046
01:58:54,135 --> 01:58:57,794
Leave you or save you?

1047
01:58:58,268 --> 01:58:59,755
Shall l leave you?

1048
01:59:00,602 --> 01:59:02,726
Did you say anything bad about me?

1049
01:59:05,129 --> 01:59:08,560
A good wife for a bad man.

1050
01:59:08,927 --> 01:59:10,693
Through the test of fire...

1051
01:59:11,632 --> 01:59:13,287
... pure gold.

1052
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:27,746
We are cheap men but never allowed
even wind to touch the pure gold.

1053
01:59:34,614 --> 01:59:35,945
Nothing else?

1054
01:59:38,178 --> 01:59:43,736
Go... take her away before
l change my mind.

1055
01:59:49,644 --> 01:59:52,605
Hold on to me... come up.

1056
01:59:52,802 --> 01:59:53,605
That's it.

1057
02:00:15,234 --> 02:00:17,715
Veera is happy, why are you sad?

1058
02:00:26,687 --> 02:00:29,281
Held you in captive for

1059
02:00:36,585 --> 02:00:38,639
Are 14 days so long?

1060
02:00:40,821 --> 02:00:45,175
Didn't feel so much when
l left you blindfolded?

1061
02:00:47,012 --> 02:00:52,564
But why am l so happy
on your coming back?

1062
02:01:02,709 --> 02:01:07,131
Please don't cry.

1063
02:01:07,501 --> 02:01:08,989
Stop!

1064
02:01:10,238 --> 02:01:11,825
l don't like women crying.

1065
02:01:22,065 --> 02:01:23,615
My life has come alive.

1066
02:01:25,863 --> 02:01:27,449
lt has started breathing.

1067
02:01:29,158 --> 02:01:30,551
Dev told me wrong.

1068
02:01:31,959 --> 02:01:33,754
He never listened to me.

1069
02:01:36,888 --> 02:01:38,547
Why did SP speak bad about you?

1070
02:01:41,983 --> 02:01:43,744
Without any reason?

1071
02:01:46,950 --> 02:01:49,538
Suspected me.
- Suspected you?

1072
02:01:51,882 --> 02:01:52,899
SP?

1073
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:20,895
Great... excellent!
- Dev is not here.

1074
02:02:22,829 --> 02:02:24,454
You're very smart.

1075
02:02:26,029 --> 02:02:27,756
He doesn't know l've come for you.

1076
02:02:27,962 --> 02:02:32,288
You know very well who
can lead you to me.

1077
02:02:34,290 --> 02:02:35,485
Come out.

1078
02:02:35,692 --> 02:02:36,811
Come...

1079
02:03:10,277 --> 02:03:12,794
l told you l'll come back for you.

1080
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:18,363
SP! Shoot me.

1081
02:03:19,001 --> 02:03:22,226
Shoot me... . shoot me...

1082
02:03:22,930 --> 02:03:23,955
Shoot me!

1083
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:28,524
Not just one shot, fire ten times.

1084
02:03:28,725 --> 02:03:30,217
Spray hundreds of bullets.

1085
02:03:30,394 --> 02:03:32,721
Shoot me... . shoot me...

1086
02:03:33,593 --> 02:03:35,287
Shoot me... .

1087
02:03:35,593 --> 02:03:36,748
Ragini, move aside.

1088
02:03:36,956 --> 02:03:38,614
You can't kill my happiness.

1089
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:39,846
Move!

1090
02:03:40,222 --> 02:03:41,552
You can't kill.

1091
02:03:42,957 --> 02:03:44,213
Move!

1092
02:04:18,237 --> 02:04:29,526
Fly away... fly away...

1093
02:04:35,330 --> 02:04:39,262
End of a story...

1094
02:04:41,326 --> 02:04:47,048
Heart is at peace with death... .

1095
02:04:47,319 --> 02:04:52,777
The spring will not come back again...

1096
02:05:03,315 --> 02:05:10,105
Will my pain ever ease?

1097
02:05:11,510 --> 02:05:13,595
ln this eternal world...
