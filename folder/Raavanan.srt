00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,725

A special task force is coming

Anyone there?

l'm not scared of you

No guts to fight a man...

52
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,482
...so you pick on a woman

53

Victory will be yours...

60
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:05,509
Of your many sins,
the worst sin is abducting me

61
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,729
-She will die
-She won't

62
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,526
14 hours to go before we
blow her funeral conch

Let her swim some more

Can't you see?
lt's the police

-Smart men never win
-Return the gun. -Go man!

-Especially one without a gun
-Catch him! -Do you wan to catch?

78
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,158
-I swear I am a watch man!
-Come down

79
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,235
Come down. Or you're dead

80
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,632
As if you could fly like me.
l am going to escape

-Are you a forest guard?
-For 28 years

84

-You have a record for
getting suspended. -Yes, sir!

86
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,426
Suspended now, sir.
But, two months whizz by..

87
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,628
Know your way round the forest?

88
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,230
Or only round a bottle?

89
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,969
ls your leaping about
thanks to alcohol?

90
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:19,841
You playing decoy?

91
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:26,714
Sir, you're a
government servant, inspector

92
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,653
with a great track record
A top police officer

00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,051
l'm a government servant too.

94
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,660
A-one forest guard

95
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,126
l've been waiting
for 3 hours for you

96
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:42,727
l won't let you go alone, sir

97
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,821
l don't trust him.
He's a drunk

98
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,354
Could be Veera's man

99
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,621
Can't tell his arse from his elbow

100
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,963
l don't trust him.
He has a short fuse

101
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,295
A right idiot

102
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,028
He's clueless about the forest
and everything else

103
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,104
l'll box your ears

104
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,831
Will you box my ears?

105
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,238
Are you from Thoothukudi?

106
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,842
l like Thoothukudi folk.
But you could be the exception

107
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,902
l should let you lose
among the forest beasts

108
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,642
-Escape..!
-l'll kill you idiot

109
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,322
Veera. Also called Veerayya

110
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,120
Born in Vikrama Singhapuram

111
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:50,591
Every local police station
has a file on him

112
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,064
63 charges against him

113
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,203
l was transferred here
to finish him off

114
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,403
Ambasamudram Circle

115
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,246
No reception!
No escort

116
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,749
l know you don't care for all that

117
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,816
l believe that many people here
do not like the police

118
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:12,754
ls that true?

119
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:17,887
l'll stay far away from such people

120
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,355
Excepting one...

121
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,964
...the man they call Raavanan

122
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,500
The ten-headed Raavanan

123
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,909
Shake the central head,
the others will shake too

124
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,504
Shall we give it a go?

125
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,117
His elder brother Singarasu
is Veera's front man

126
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,317
The lawmaker

127
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,784
Brother Sakkarai is somewhat educated

128
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,584
He settles disputes

129
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:54,261
Veera consoles when blood is shed..

130
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:59,536
..and takes revenge for any killings

131
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,801
Why can't you arrest him?

132
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,071
We needed an lnspector like Dev

133
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,612
The other lnspectors feared Veera

134
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,076
What are do?

135
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,679
Guardian angel to some

136
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,710
Terror to others.
And to us..

137
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,320
Veera is a lawbreaker and violent man

138
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,953
A terrorist

139
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,893
The police are supposed to
protect us from men like him

140
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:30,224
You must stop him.
Shoot him

141
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,167
l had a chance to get this Raavanan

142
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,302
but he got away

143
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,572
This time l will get him

144
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,644
l won't rest till l do

145
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,179
Be brave till then, Ragini

146
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:47,514
lnspector. Stop here

147
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,985
Just a moment

148
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:57,985
ln the forest ears are
as useful as eyes

149
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,974
Thoothukudi! Look, he's here

150
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:52,976
Who tied you up?

151
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,849
Stop chewing.
Are you the boatman?

152
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,115
You gasping?
Get some water for him

153
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,596
What? He said you'd come
and untie me?

154
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,661
He said we'd come
and untie you?

155
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,596
Come on, tell me

156
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,862
They asked you to come
to the mountaintop..

157
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,872
..if you are very smart

158
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,409
Veera ties him up and tells
him where he's headed

159
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,946
Are we looking for him?
Or is he looking for us?

160
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,277
Right?

161
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,683
-Mountaintop -He asked us to come
to the mountaintop

162
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,151
Tell to sir

163
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,351
Did you see her?

164
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,229
ls she all right?
ls she hurt?

165
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,466
Was she crying?

166
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,539
Leave me
l won't come

167
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:33,615
Leave me

168
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,519
Leave me

169
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,328
What are you doing?
l won't come

170
00:17:58,777 --> 00:17:59,869
You will be ruined

171
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,277
Our curse won't leave you

172
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,214
May you suffer all your life.

173
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,745
You'll pay for your husband's sins

174
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,400
Who are you to kill me?

175
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,271
Who gave you that right?

176
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:13,011
Why must l pay for men
who fight each other?

177
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,552
My life is mine.
lt belongs to me

178
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,220
Stop!
Not another sound

179
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,557
Already 10 voices in my head

180
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,690
Veera! Kill her. Don't hesitate

181
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,166
Shoot her

182
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,295
-l won't die.
-Damn you!

183
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:37,371
End the wretch's life.
Let the world know

184
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,909
You can't kill me

185
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,307
The voices in my head

186
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,113
Shiva dancing in fury

187
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,914
A question
An answer

188
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:50,519
Eternal dilemmas
Anger, Calm, Revenge, Peace

189
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,127
-You can't kill me
-Die laughing

190
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,855
-You'll laugh for 7 lives.
-l won't die

191
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,059
-lf not, you won't..
-My end isn't in your hands

192
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:09,866
You foolish girl!

193
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,289
When you were Born on this earth?

194
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,827
Why you Iit a spark in my mind?

195
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,486
The teak forest is taII and mighty

196
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,567
A matchstick has no height

197
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,830
The teak forest is taII and mighty

198
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,375
A matchstick has no height

199
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:57,779
Yet the faIIing matchstick
Sets the teak forest on fire

200
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:03,512
I die Bit By Bit
seeing the quiver of your Iip

201
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:10,786
O BeIoved, I impIore you
Give me your heart

202
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:15,831
Standing on the other shore,
Ionging to reach you

203
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,529
Enough! You're hurting my ears

204
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:21,739
l said stop

205
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:23,404
l'm not crying

206
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,942
Swallow your tears now

207
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:28,943
Come

208
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,476
Find yourself another
woman to follow you

209
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,284
Have you no shame?

210
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,853
You coward, abducting a woman

211
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,617
All the abuse in the world
was made for you

212
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:47,098
Bravo, Veera! The weeping has stopped

213
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:51,898
Better to hear swear words
than a woman's sobs

214
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,707
The circIing sun and moon
come together in a Iine

215
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:01,909
ABstinence and honesty Iose their grip

216
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:07,985
I die Bit By Bit
Seeing the quiver of your Iip

217
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,851
O BeIoved, I impIore you

218
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,256
Give me your heart

219
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:20,522
Standing on the other shore,
Ionging to reach you

220
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:25,899
A fruit that scorches
is desired fruit aII the same

221
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,705
This story is a story toId Before

222
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,178
A few aIways defy the ruIes

223
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:15,047
Man creates ruIes
exceptions too

224
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,189
Even goats look before jumping

225
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,256
Can't you use your brains?

226
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,057
Why did you save me?

227
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,736
Vultures wouldn't prey on you

228
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,602
Then why did you?

229
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,066
Killing you was in my fate

230
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,609
Some bastard erased it

231
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,406
Pray, if you believe in God

232
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:48,208
Your end is in my hands
lt is written in stone

233
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,548
What did you say?

234
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,755
No bastard will erase
your death from my fate

235
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:06,234
Gazing at the faraway sun,
the Iotus comes to flower

236
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:11,306
Light rays may separate them,
But their Bond is strong

237
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:16,312
Is it a Bud? Or poisonous weed?
Can't teII them apart

238
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:21,315
The poison spreads
But the heart is ever fearIess

239
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,044
One day I wiII meet my end

240
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,723
WiII your face fade from my eyes?

241
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,658
I Iay Buried with you in my heart

242
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:34,198
The circIing sun and moon
come together in a Iine

243
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:39,328
ABstinence and honesty Iose their grip

244
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:45,404
I die Bit By Bit
Seeing the quiver of your Iip

245
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:52,877
O BeIoved, I impIore you
Give me your heart

246
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:57,954
Standing on the other shore,
Ionging to reach you

247
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:03,491
A fruit that scorches
is desired fruit aII the same

248
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,321
Veera, they're waiting for you

249
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,841
Move along
Veera is coming

250
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,978
-How are you?
-Go away!

251
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,855
l now understand
why you didn't kill her

252
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,855
What a fool!
lt escaped me

253
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,332
One bullet would have done the trick

254
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:18,065
A case would be filed. Sakkarai
and l would serve five years for you

255
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,136
The problem will be solved

256
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,268
But you have a plan

257
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,476
What plan?

258
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,743
ln only 14 hours the lnspector...

259
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,279
...panics and brings truckloads of men

260
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,952
What would've happened in 14 days!

261
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,679
What a plan!

262
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:43,021
A gun my hand...
Two minutes from her death

263
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,431
But in her eyes
not a grain of fear

264
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,635
How to kill someone
who isn't scared of dying?

265
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,169
lf you were in my place,
what would you have done?

266
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,110
l don't have a brilliant
my mind to think so far

267
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,511
Ask for a tasty goat soup.
l'll make it

268
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:15,860
Ask me to fix someone
or send him to jail

269
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,459
lt's done

270
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:22,597
But all this business of women,
their courage, way beyond me

271
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,682
This is no circus. Go!

272
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,756
No sari shops here

273
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,958
A plantain leaf. My size

274
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,688
Wrap it round and tuck it
in with a pin. Try it!

275
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,491
Go away!
l will tell you

276
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,370
Didn't l tell you to scoot?

277
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,030
Doesn't fear guns nor has any humour

278
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,640
What a life!

279
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,303
Some food. Treat it better

280
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,249
Throw it away!

281
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:18,454
l'm not an animal you tie up and feed

282
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:22,856
Be grateful. For generations
We've sweated blood to get food

283
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:27,062
-Your snobby attitude
-And your attitude?

284
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,665
Ah! Women

285
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:34,536
l felt sorry for her,
brought her clothes and food

286
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,198
Even my wife doesn't talk to me like that

287
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,469
Eat, if you're hungry

288
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:41,937
lf you regard me an enemy, don't eat

289
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:43,677
lt's up to you

290
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:55,485
Now you've eaten our salt,
you'll have to be loyal to us

291
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,485
For always

292
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,953
-Go and watch out
-A pistol shot

293
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,282
Maybe it is

294
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,023
They're telling us where they are

295
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,845
Greetings! Don't be scared

296
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,249
The lnspector is here.
Ask them, sir

297
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,793
Where is Veera?
Where is he?

298
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:47,594
Where is Veera?

299
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:41,149
Veera is a soft-spoken sage

300
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:42,541
What rubbish!

301
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,917
A sage? Get lost, you

302
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,986
He's fearless

303
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:51,721
He is a match for anyone

304
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,320
-That's it!
-Even the God of Death

305
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,860
These men don't know anything

306
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,525
Sir, his heart is clear as water

307
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,670
He's like a mother to us

308
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,400
Likes a bit of mischief
and creates some problem

309
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,470
Creates some for us too

310
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:11,881
A poet. He speaks in verse

311
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,582
Great poet Thiruvalluvar?

312
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,419
Women go crazy over him

313
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,586
Not all women
Go!

314
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:28,797
From pantomime to street theater
he excels in everything

315
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:33,961
A Great comic, splits your sides

316
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,169
And your liver burns
Go

317
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,764
He's dangerous

318
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:43,546
Drinking, killing, fighting
and womanizing

319
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,051
He has every vice
and his drum-playing...

320
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,991
He seems like the God of Death

321
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,116
-No escaping death.
-Stop

322
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,924
You're confusing me with your
10 accounts of him

323
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,396
My head spins

324
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,366
Your hand..
...is so rough

325
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:18,737
When our marriage was arranged...

326
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,975
...and our horoscopes matched...

327
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,581
...my mother didn't ask
if you had soft skin

328
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,516
My precious dancer,

329
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,917
a police officer has dangerous hands

330
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:38,458
Are these hands unsoiled?

331
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,057
Cross your heart and tell me

332
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,099
-O wise saint, l'll tell you
-Naughty

333
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:58,611
Dearest heart-thief

334
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:04,021
O dweIIer in eyes

335
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:08,487
See me with your hands

336
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:13,563
HoId me with your eyes

337
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,694
Teach me the art of Iove

338
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:25,033
Lost in thought of you,
my eyes know no sIeep

339
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:29,511
Master, my master
How much I adore you

340
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,980
Grace me with your Iove

341
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:41,388
With every passing week,
my Iove grows

342
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,996
Wrap me around your Being

343
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:36,504
Need I teII you of my desires?

344
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,246
Need I teII you of my desires?

345
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:48,383
Can't you discover them?

346
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:58,333
Your touch Brings me aIive
Come. RuIe my heart

347
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:07,735
The TamiI Ianguage
expresses every nuance

348
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:18,281
And you?
Do you know Iove's nuances?

349
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:22,949
Dearest heart-thief

350
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,842
l came here running
when he told me about you

351
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,456
What are you blabbering?
Come

352
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,990
l'm scared.
Oh my goddess!

353
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:02,529
Get out of there!

354
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,792
Come out!

355
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,801
Be a man

356
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,137
l didn't do it. l swear

357
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,873
lt wasn't me. l promise

358
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,868
l know nothing

359
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:16,978
Out with the truth!

360
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,414
No trouble getting here?

361
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:24,650
What's this?

362
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:27,555
A watch

363
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,351
The one l gave you?

364
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,094
l gave you my sister too

365
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,637
Where is she?

366
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,572
-l don't know
-Did you lose her?

367
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,716
-Out with it! -You didn't lose the watch,
but you lost my sister

368
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,847
-The watch was safe
-Ask him to let me go

369
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,584
-l don't know anything.
-Where is my sister?

370
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,923
Trust me.
Ask him to let me go

371
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,584
Veerayya, believe me,
l know nothing

372
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,406
Growl like villains!

373
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,807
The photo should scare them

374
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,279
Hey, camera! Start clicking

375
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,219
You clicking?
Or must l click you?

376
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,885
The lnspector's wife
is flapping like a bird

377
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,615
Thump her on the head.
She'll stay still

378
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,263
A scarecrow

379
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,930
lt wouldn't even scare the crows

380
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,267
Careful!

381
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:38,612
Find out where the nearest hospital is

382
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,019
Bring the truck inside

383
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,617
The first-aid box!

384
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:49,291
His blood is clotting.
He must be taken to a hospital

385
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,229
Leave us alone

386
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,567
Bring the stratcher.
Where is the ice box?

387
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:02,774
Veera's brother-in-law?
Right?

388
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,438
-He cut my hand off
-l thought you were family

389
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,109
-The animal cut my hand off.
-ls it?

390
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:15,117
But why leave you here
with a severed hand?

391
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,121
The pain is killing me

392
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,392
Take me to a hospital, sir

393
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:28,931
Dressed you in my wife's clothes

394
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,473
What's he trying to tell me?

395
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,138
No sir

396
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,679
-lt's paining..!
-Why did he send you?

397
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,278
-My hand pain is killing me...
-ls he scaring me?

398
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,013
Will he cut off my hand too?

399
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,337
Where are you?

400
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,946
They'll kill me
if you don't come soon

401
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,153
Are you trying to see
how brave l am?

402
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,255
l'm not that brave

403
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:26,620
l'm just pretending
l scream..

404
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,556
..and put up a brave front

405
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,363
Have you given up, Dev?

406
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:37,770
Answer me!

407
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,244
When will you come?

408
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:56,822
Hey lady!

409
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,064
Scream away.
Your God won't come

410
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,599
-Or your husband
-Here!

411
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,401
Some food. Take it

412
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,198
Eat it and sleep.
Calm down

413
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,307
She'll eat. Let's go

414
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,745
-The tape is running.
-lts working -Talk now

415
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,021
Hello lnspector
Greeting!

416
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,818
How are you?

417
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,556
Not well, l hope

418
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,224
Our troubles are caused
by big shots like you

419
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,430
lt's Veerayya

420
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,760
Poor, uneducated

421
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,697
Not high born like you

422
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:45,039
So, an enemy. The villain

423
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:46,901
Did you see the photo?

424
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,844
Recognise her?

425
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:54,450
We took it for you with great care

426
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,186
Keep it safe.
Or you may lose it

427
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,388
lf she doesn't return
you'll at least have the photo

428
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,462
Are you angry?

429
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,329
lt hurts, right?

430
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:15,931
Does grief weight
heavy on the heart?

431
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:24,670
We abducted one woman
from your home and...

432
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:28,218
...the police rampage through the forest
Trampling elephant to mosquito

433
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,158
Are your women fragile flowers?
And ours mere gravel?

434
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,893
lnspector, pray..

435
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,834
..that your wife won't suffer
the same fate as our sister

436
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,641
Keep the photo safe

437
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:21,335
Anyone there?

438
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,074
Stop

439
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,569
Where to?

440
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:15,846
Be good. Go back.
Tie yourself up. And sleep

441
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,253
Understand?

442
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:39,472
O forest girI!

443
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:49,443
O forest girI! Where do you BeIong?

444
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:55,019
WiII she Bring rain? Or thunder?.

445
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,225
Or vanish?

446
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:06,364
On seeing her pure face

447
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,173
the forest heaved a sigh

448
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:20,178
Lightning struck

449
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,788
The heart quickened

450
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:38,328
O forest girI! Where do you BeIong?

451
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:50,074
My Iife is desiring for you

452
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:58,813
This wretched heart of mine
Ioses aII controI

453
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,593
O heart of mine

454
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:13,365
O heart of mine

455
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,620
Let me go home

456
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:49,297
O forest girl! Where do you belong?

457
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:57,938
WiII she Bring rain? Or thunder?.

458
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,481
Or vanish?

459
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:15,829
O forest girI!

460
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:25,866
O forest girI! Where do you BeIong?

461
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:32,774
WiII she Bring rain? Or thunder?.

462
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,875
Or vanish?

463
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:52,359
-The river is flowing Iike a deer..
-Let's push her into the water

464
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:55,563
-It is flowing Iike a deer..
-Oh gosh!

465
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,640
Rasathi come up!

466
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,572
Hey Veera uncle has come

467
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:05,972
-We pushed Rasathi into water.
-Rotate it fast

468
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,046
Rotate it fast

469
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:13,318
Rotate it a little faster

470
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,862
-She looks like one of us.
-Yes

471
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:25,992
Hey Kuruvamma!

472
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:27,933
Hey Kuruvamma!

473
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,538
Send me back or tie me up

474
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,735
Wander in the sun with us
and turn dark like us

475
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,341
She is staring at you

476
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:46,614
-Why don't you stay with us?
-Why don't you stay with us?

477
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:48,684
Where are you going?

478
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,153
Answer me

479
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,226
Will you stay with us or not?

480
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,228
Where is your gun?

481
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:04,566
-Take out it and shoot me
-Keep quiet. She is angry.

482
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,902
Better that, than asking me
such a question

483
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,635
Very well. Shouldn't have asked

484
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,442
The lnspector shouldn't have met you

485
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,376
Shouldn't have married you

486
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:17,783
Shouldn't have come here

487
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:21,122
Shouldn't have done what he did

488
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:24,387
Shouldn't have wanted to shoot you
You shouldn't have jumped

489
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,052
Shouldn't have saved you

490
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,533
Shouldn't have felt alive
when you opened your eyes

491
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,599
What's done is done.
And can't be undone

492
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:39,337
My feelings can't be changed

493
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,069
My words can't be taken back

494
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:43,479
Will you stay?

495
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,810
lf you weren't married...

496
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,082
...would you stay?

497
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:03,690
Are you eating jungle food?

498
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,366
Corn and yam?

499
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,771
No wedding feast here

500
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,701
We have to make do.
Right, Akaash?

501
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,368
But don't drop anything

502
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:21,650
Everyone will know our whereabouts

503
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:26,180
Veera appears to know...

504
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,923
...every step we take

505
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,864
A little forest bird..

506
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:43,464
..seems to be singing in his ear

507
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:48,137
''The lnspector is coming
from the East''

508
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,413
Anyone seen this forest bird?

509
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:56,613
What about you, Ranjit?

510
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,023
How long?

511
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:05,688
What have you told Veera?

512
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:07,557
l don't get it, sir

513
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,359
Where we are.
And how many

514
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,424
l can't..

515
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:15,502
Talk to me

516
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,497
Sir, you're assaulting an officer

517
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,842
Don't you feel ashamed
to be called a police officer?

518
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,178
-l can hit back too, sir
-Just try

519
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,517
-Where is Veera?
-l don't know, sir

520
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,990
Take me to Veera

521
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:06,013
You stay 6 months or a year,
then you're transferred

522
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,214
We have to live here

523
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,751
My brothers and sisters study here

524
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:12,421
Who guarantees their safety?

525
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:14,356
-He's right, sir.
-So..!

526
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,558
You wear a police uniform
and are loyal to Veera?

527
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:17,894
He is right

528
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:05,271
-l don't know where he is
-Tell us what you know

529
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:07,343
We will find Veera

530
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:27,225
-What's wrong?
-Vehicle has stopped

531
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:31,634
The fuel cap is missing

532
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,242
Move aside

533
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:38,445
Sugar

534
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:41,516
ln all three trucks?

535
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,242
How did they do it?

536
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:46,985
l am not

537
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:53,525
l don't know

538
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:58,998
Sir, the villagers need to cross
the camp to graze their cattle

539
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,724
The lnspector's tent?

540
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:28,346
Hemanth, here is a problem
they've sabotaged our trucks

541
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:04,811
The sacrificiaI goat is cooking in

542
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,412
the cIay kiIn, drinks pouring

543
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:10,014
The IoveBird is fiIIed with Ionging

544
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:12,219
O eIders, marry them today

545
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,291
What shall we cut the tongue?

546
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,700
The nose? Eh?

547
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,767
Ok. How about the ears?

548
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:54,732
-Your turn next. Shave him
-No..!

549
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,199
Catch him!

550
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,809
Shave his head

551
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:10,280
My brother lost a bet

552
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:14,418
He said we'd never return alive
from the police camp

553
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,549
Shave his head

554
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:24,098
l have seen your husband's palace

555
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:28,830
And a photo

556
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:32,431
Not of you. Of me

557
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,508
Snarling like a villain.
Real mean

558
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:37,713
You..

559
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:41,913
A demon's photo in a king's tent

560
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:49,783
Sit him on a donkey
Catch him

561
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:03,866
SIay them..

562
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,006
...if a Iine is drawn

563
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,075
If a fence is made...

564
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:16,145
...puII it down

565
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:22,356
You aIways ruIed. We ruIe now

566
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,490
SIay them..

567
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:28,491
...if a Iine is drawn

568
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,697
If a fence is made...

569
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:36,701
...puII it down

570
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:42,910
Heads Iowered for eons.
Heads heId high now

571
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:48,582
They want to share a meaI?
Lay out a feast

572
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:52,848
They want a share of our riches?
Off with their heads

573
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:56,982
Make the ruIes.
We won't oBey

574
01:04:57,093 --> 01:05:01,052
The sky won't heed rumBIing cIouds

575
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:05,259
No one can cIaim our ancestors' Iand

576
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:42,093
We Befriend snakes too.
Open hearted is our cIan

577
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:46,231
Mess with us.
Invite trouBIe

578
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:50,301
Born to a Brave mother

579
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:54,440
When the BuII charges guts spiII..

580
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:57,485
Our forefathers had
nothing to Ieave to us...

581
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:58,712
OnIy their Bravery

582
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,850
SIay them...

583
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:05,192
...if a Iine is drawn

584
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,262
If a fence is made...

585
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:13,132
...puII it down

586
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:57,636
The aroma of homemade food
wafts in the air

587
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:02,184
Sip our water, strong as country Iiquor

588
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:06,050
Deprived Iives can survive
drought and famine

589
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:10,387
A cactus can Iive without monsoon rains

590
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:14,520
StruggIing forever does not
make you poor

591
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:18,657
Lose dignity. And right away
you have nothing

592
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:22,727
We honour mother and wife.
And just as proud of our Iand

593
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:27,070
The soiI of our forefathers
is watered with our BIood

594
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:30,138
SIay them...

595
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,211
...if a Iine is drawn

596
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:37,346
If a fence is made...

597
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:41,349
...puII it down

598
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:47,625
You aIways ruIed.
We ruIe now

599
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:55,227
SIay them...

600
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:58,630
...if a Iine is drawn

601
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,102
If a fence is made...

602
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:05,438
...puII it down

603
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:13,114
You aIways ruIed.
We ruIe now

604
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,300
Look at me

605
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,139
Can you hear me?

606
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:40,481
Open your eyes

607
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:56,829
Ah! The captive freeing the caged

608
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:58,797
Nice game

609
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,630
What will you do to him?

610
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:04,899
Sit him on a buffalo and

611
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,070
pack him off to the God of Death?

612
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:11,770
ls no one human to you?

613
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:16,982
When will your savagery end?

614
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,077
When will their savagery end?

615
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:31,029
You only see the uniform.
Not the man

616
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:37,101
He's human too
Devoted to his family

617
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,473
Why do you torture him?

618
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:48,680
Shoot him at once. Kill him.
Stamp him. Shoot him

619
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:52,920
Answer her question

620
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:55,985
Answer her

621
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:01,887
You mother's boy

622
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,697
Fool! Respecting ladies?

623
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:09,862
Tell her what you did to Vennila

624
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,101
Who's Vennila?

625
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,412
The girl who changed your life

626
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:23,951
Who's Vennila?

627
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:27,019
Tell her about Vennila

628
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:29,215
Our stepsister

629
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:34,854
The daughter of father's second wife

630
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,896
Vennila was smart. And brave

631
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,334
The only one who didn't fear Veera

632
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,571
She fell in love with a boy

633
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,538
A high society type like you

634
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:13,067
Veera had to persuade the family that
Vennila could marry him

635
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,795
Hers was the first wedding in the family

636
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:19,202
She was overjoyed

637
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,909
Lightning struck

638
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,445
The heart quickened

639
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:27,140
Lightning struck

640
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:29,717
The heart quickened

641
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:35,222
My heart is Iooking for her

642
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:42,753
On seeing her pure face
it got sunk

643
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:48,497
-Another henna lady is here
-Send her in

644
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:53,632
O forest girI! Where do you BeIong?

645
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:56,302
-Let's go!
-WiII she Bring rain? Or thunder?.

646
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,778
Or vanish?

647
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:03,909
O forest girI! Where do you BeIong?

648
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:06,613
WiII she Bring rain? Or thunder?.

649
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:08,189
Or vanish?

650
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,155
You look nice in a sari

651
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,022

Dressed in a sari, escorted by eunuchs
You got away with it.

654
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,532
Otherwise my brothers

White belt
No one can touch me

657
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,373
You're scared of no one?

658
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,449
-And now?
-Stop! Are you crazy?

659
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:43,152
-You said that you're scared of no one
-Close the door. Someone will see us

660
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:48,256
lf your brothers see me, l'm dead

661

Show them your Judo Are you nuts?
Don't open the door!

662
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,295
Where did your guts vanish?

663
01:12:56,905 --> 01:13:02,138
-Stop, will you? -Let's show the world
how brave you are. -You..

664
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:05,713
Damn it. We are caught

665
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:07,172
Why did you abuse?

666
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:08,249
Shouldn't l abuse?

667
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:09,510
-Hide.
-Why?

668
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:11,117

01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:13,617
Where should l go?

671
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:17,186
Why has he come now?

672
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,923
-Hey girl
-What? -l am dead

673
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:24,093
-Open the door
-Can't open it now

674
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:26,392
-Oh gosh!
-Who's inside?

675
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:27,665
What are you asking?

676
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:29,064
Just me and my shadow are here

677
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:32,737
Someone came to you to apply henna,
isn't it? l know

l'm changing my sari

679
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:37,007
How can you change your clothes
with henna in your hands?

680
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,009
-There is that lady
-Oh god!

681
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,546
Brother-in-law?
What are you doing here?

682
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:46,348
Not his mistake.
l asked him to come

683
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,021
And he came running?

684
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:50,488
l told him to prove
he had the guts

685
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,425
So he comes in a sari?

686
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,085
What are you doing in girls' quarters?

687
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:57,698
-No reason
-l was holding hands

688
01:13:58,667 --> 01:13:59,497
Who with?

689
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:08,575
Come here

690
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,077
With which hand you hold her?

691
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:21,382
Don't harm him

692
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,716
Brother said he'd give him a bike
for our wedding

693
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:25,521
He'd look a clown riding
with one hand

694
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,719
He should've thought of that earlier

695
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,460
Which hand?

696
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:31,929
Which hand?

697
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:44,069
Open your eyes

698
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:46,739
Look at the time

699
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:50,017
Two more days till the wedding

700
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:53,680
Keep your hands to yourself till then

701
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:56,550
Or you'll be garlanding her
with one hand

702
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:02,357
Now go

703
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:04,689
You tell him

704
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,696
Or else, he'll be glued here.

705
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:21,781
Adorn the garland
101st goat

706

761
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:08,768
Hey groom!

Hey groom!

763
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:35,200
Brother!

764
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:48,212
Dev must have had
a good reason

765
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:53,615
lt can't be his fault

766
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:01,355
The fault is mine

767
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,824
Brother!

768
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:07,766
Eight men pulled me away

769
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:14,835
l shouldn't have left Vennila alone

770
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:18,504
l should've obeyed my conscience

771
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:20,842
Veera should have known

772
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:25,452
l didn't think that
the groom would run away

773
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:28,383
Vela, don't go

774
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:38,062
This mother's boy...

775
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:41,396
...took my Vennila from
wedding to police station

776
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:49,336
Tell me in which rat hole
is your brother hiding?

777
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,608
Till then you stay

778
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:06,221
l'll get you talking

779
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:09,224
So what if you're a woman

780
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,356
Talk to me

781
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:15,835
The police have sharp noses

782
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:19,370
Sniff him out

783
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:22,769
You will get ruined
Your family wouldn't prosper

784
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:23,902
l'll cut your nose off

785
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:28,245
You took her to the police station

786
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:29,442
Didn't you?

787
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:05,546
Are you badly hurt?

788
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:08,089
Can't you speak?

789
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:13,357
Never mind

790
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,363
You can't squabble with me now

791
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:19,566
l can say anything l want

792
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:22,297
You can't argue with me

793
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,439
Sister-in-law, did you see my husband?

794
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,310
How quickly he ran

795
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:35,240
Tail between his legs

796
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:38,916
Who wants a husband like that?

797
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,788
Why did l want to marry him?

798
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,796
Better to stay unmarried like you

799
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:57,469
But who the hell are the police...

800
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:05,538
...to have ruined my wedding?

801
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,487
l wasn't scared

802
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:21,691
They asked me that
your husband has scurried off

803
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:27,635
So with whom will you
spend your nuptial night?

804
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:35,842
l swore at them

805
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,443
l begged, 'Don't do it'

806
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:45,112
But l couldn't stop them

807
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:56,855
l told myself l would soon be home

808
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,533
They wouldn't let me go

809
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:06,865
l screamed and begged
They didn't leave me

810
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,341
The bastards took turns.
All night

811
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,484
My life is in tatters

812
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:20,881
l lost everything

813
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,121
Vennila!

814
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:00,985
Watch out

815
01:25:07,368 --> 01:25:09,461
Pull it

816
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:11,269
Pull it

817
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:20,679
Slowly!

818
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:26,477
Come fast

819
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:30,678
-Get a blanket
-l will

820
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:34,686
You're nothing to worry

821
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:38,957
They've stripped him of everything

822
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:43,019
No hair. No dignity.
Nothing left

823
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:45,763
He's breathing

824
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:50,429
You're still alive.
Damn the rest

825
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:53,039
-You don't worry
-Where's that blanket? Hurry

826
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,971
-Don't worry.
-l am bringing it, sir

827
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:57,374
Can you hear me, Hemanth?

828
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:02,949
l'll tell you one thing
A stiff drink will...

829
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:06,284
-Hurry up
-Lift him. -Ok sir

830
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:10,553
He was there for a few hours

831
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:12,148
And madam? For 8 days

832
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:15,696
-Enough!
-l say ''enough'' too

833
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:18,094
-Take him to camp..
-When big convoys like ours advance,

834
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:20,360
..everyone knows.
Even the ants

835
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:24,699
They'll take us one by one
and make us bald

836
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:26,429
Any bright ideas?

837
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:30,976
One, sir. l need your permission
That's enough

838
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:49,863
Give me strength

839
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:53,729
Don't take my anger away

840
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,528
Anger gives me the will to live

841
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:02,208
Stop them from showing
compassion to me

842
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:04,405
l beg you

843
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:07,204
Don't show bad people in good light

844
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:09,744
Nor show them as truthful

845
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:21,151
Give me the courage to fight

846
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:23,830
My anger cannot lessen

847
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:26,229
Can't you do that much for me?

848
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:45,250
Did l barge in like a bull?

849
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:51,719
What kind of man is he?

850
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:54,920
Your inspector

851
01:28:55,563 --> 01:28:56,393
A good man...

852
01:28:58,032 --> 01:28:58,999
...or a very good man?

853
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:04,663
God-like, enough?

854
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:09,741
God-like?

855
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:12,276
Divine?

856
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:14,939
An ideal man?

857
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:17,812
A man with no flaws?

858
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:23,416
Won't ten heads together equal him?

859
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:28,026
Not even close

860
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:32,422
What's he like? Good-looking?

861
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:35,766
Handsome, no doubt

862
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,100
What else would you expect?

863
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:44,909
l must see him.
At least once

864
01:29:48,282 --> 01:29:50,250
To see what he's like in person

865
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:54,387
l should ask him
why he met you first

866
01:29:58,359 --> 01:29:59,383
ls he loving?

867
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:03,394
Does he make you laugh?

868
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:13,003
And you...

869
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:19,611
Do you love him?

870
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:29,753
l feel jealous

871
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:35,290
A burning ache deep inside

872
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:46,035
Does your god feel jealous too?

873
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,437
No. Only Veera does

874
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:59,181
The downtrodden, the uncouth brute

875
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:02,717
Not a match to you

876
01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:04,257
Or your God-like husband

877
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:10,322
But jealousy has made me
suddenly feel matchless

878
01:31:10,898 --> 01:31:13,128
lt has made me suddenly feel invincible

879
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:19,400
This demon of jealousy..

880
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:24,877
..has made me all-powerful

881
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:30,140
Where are you?

882
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:40,426
lt will be tasty if we add more..

883
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:43,357
Don't say no

884
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:07,715
l'm a forest guard..

885
01:32:07,822 --> 01:32:10,052
Do you eat sour fruit?

886
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:14,723
Bite the onion
and swallow the sour fruit

887
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:16,524
lmagine it's a feast

888
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:21,327
A wedding feast is very tasty!

889
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:27,535
Your husband has sent me to find you

890
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:30,070
Searched every inch of the forest

891
01:32:31,579 --> 01:32:33,012
Glad you're ok, Mrs. lnspector

892
01:32:33,114 --> 01:32:36,140
He gave me a keepsake.
lt is in my pocket

893
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,284
What was that noise?

894
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:50,421
Madam, here.
Look behind you

895
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:56,560
Trust me. l'll carry you
away on my shoulders

896
01:32:56,671 --> 01:32:58,639
And take you to your husband

897
01:33:00,608 --> 01:33:01,506
Why didn't Dev come?

898
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:07,372
He's five kms away

899
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:12,384
His convoy makes such a ruckus,
everyone knows when they move

900
01:33:12,486 --> 01:33:13,783
So l came up ahead

901
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:15,713
Don't hesitate

902
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:18,391
They are wild people.
They aren't kind

903
01:33:18,626 --> 01:33:19,854
Say the word

904
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:24,057
-We'll throw chilli
in their eyes and escape -Oh God!

905
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:27,668
Don't hurt him.
You already have me captive

906
01:33:28,102 --> 01:33:30,002
l am going to slay
him like a goat

907
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:31,332
Will you throw chilli at us?

908
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:50,482
Your death-knell too
l hear many sounds

909
01:33:50,658 --> 01:33:53,024
The inspector's convoy is
heading this way

910
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:55,493
Watch out

911
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:59,094
l may be from the lnspector's party

912
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:01,498
But l'll vote for you

913
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:05,498
Look around you

914
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:09,034
They will do anything
for you. Even die

915
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:10,510
Am l wrong?

916
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,040
They will do
You've done so much for them

917
01:34:16,217 --> 01:34:21,587
But l ask you, why would you
want to risk their lives?

918
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:25,255
You're the only one who'll die

919
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:27,190
You will die with in a minute..

920
01:34:28,095 --> 01:34:31,724
Send madam back with me.
Stop this quarrel

921
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:33,197
We'll drop all charges

922
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,999
-What if we don't send her back?
-Go man

923
01:34:37,104 --> 01:34:39,538
He hears the whole story.
Still gets it back to front

924
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:43,076
Need l answer?
The end of the world

925
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:44,201
All over and done with

926
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:46,073
Old man, explain

927
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:50,139
Brother, he says it'll be the
end of the world. All over

928
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:51,081
Must we shake with fear?

929
01:34:51,452 --> 01:34:53,818
-Hey! -What brother?
-Are you shaking?

930
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:55,218
l am shaking

931
01:34:57,458 --> 01:35:00,689
-Are you scared of dying?
-Why should we have fear?

932
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:05,357
-Anyone scared?
-Why are you asking like that?

933
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:08,902
No one seems scared.
So now what?

934
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:13,036
Throw stones at a dog.
lt will bark and then bite you

935
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:16,637
Force a tree branch down and let go

936
01:35:16,744 --> 01:35:17,711
lt will spring up with greater might

937
01:35:18,946 --> 01:35:20,436
What's new in your threats?

938
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:22,715
We've heard it all before

939
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:24,910
They hit us.
We hit back

940
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:28,185
They caned us.
We did the same

941
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:30,524
The bastards point guns at us now

942
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:37,654
We'll snap your necks. Understand?

943
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:42,628
Veera, l won't leave
this place without madam

944
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:49,032
Who said you were leaving? Eh?

945
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:53,244
Brother! His end is near

946
01:35:53,681 --> 01:35:56,912
Get him a drink.
Leave him at the cliff

947
01:35:57,284 --> 01:35:58,842
He'll roll down himself

948
01:36:04,892 --> 01:36:06,792
You're making a bad mistake

949
01:36:07,561 --> 01:36:10,189
He isn't against us.
He's right

950
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:13,130
Go to the lnspector then

951
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:14,661
Get yourself a uniform

952
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:18,671
Come back and
plough me with bullets

953
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,130
He's talking of peace

954
01:36:21,242 --> 01:36:22,402
Why be angry?

955
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:27,145
With ten trucks of ammunition?

956
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:28,948
Talking of peace?

957
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:33,015
He's sniffing around to see
if we're strong

958
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,213
What is our strength?

959
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:37,688
Shall l tell you? You are

960
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,756
That strength is our weakness now

961
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:42,829
l am observing,
you are arguing with him

962
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,160
Be quiet, brother
l am asking you too

963
01:36:45,533 --> 01:36:47,763
Everything has gone wrong
since she got here

964
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:48,959
A curse has fallen on us

965
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:51,363
The witch will burn us all

966
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:55,708
You said she'd die in 14 hours.
That became 14 days

967
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,644
Not in 14 years he will let her go

968
01:36:58,746 --> 01:37:02,910
-Will you stop it? Why do you
repeat it again? -Hit me

969
01:37:04,018 --> 01:37:04,985
You can hit me

970
01:37:06,554 --> 01:37:07,987
You dared to hit me

971
01:37:08,355 --> 01:37:09,720
But you don't dare question Veera

972
01:37:12,626 --> 01:37:14,719
You don't do anything.
Let me go with the forest guard

973
01:37:15,029 --> 01:37:15,859
Make him see sense

974
01:37:23,304 --> 01:37:28,469
lt is mistake going
to the police

975
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:31,875
lt's mistake.
Sending him alone is a mistake

976
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:33,412
l'll go with him

977
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:35,947
l'll go with him

978
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:38,348
You can't open your mouth
without swearing

979
01:37:38,452 --> 01:37:39,350
How can you talk peace?

980
01:37:40,654 --> 01:37:44,090
Brother, l am not a child.
And l've studied till Plus two

981
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:46,755
l know the law

982
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:49,621
Give me a chance.
Trust me

983
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:51,491
l won't let you down

984
01:38:35,442 --> 01:38:37,342
l've seen her

985
01:38:37,711 --> 01:38:38,541
Where is sir?

986
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:42,610
l found her whereabouts

987
01:38:42,716 --> 01:38:44,206
l went where no one goes

988
01:38:44,318 --> 01:38:45,683
And saw the captive one

989
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:50,018
l deserve a medal.
Gold or silver. Anything

990
01:38:50,124 --> 01:38:52,558
-ls Veera here?
-His brother is here. To talk peace

991
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:54,025
My medal?
You Mrs..

992
01:38:54,128 --> 01:38:58,030
-Where's his brother?
-Waiting, sir

993
01:38:58,132 --> 01:39:00,430
All negotiating done

994
01:39:00,534 --> 01:39:02,024
lf you say over,
everything will be finished

995
01:39:03,804 --> 01:39:04,828
Where is my BottIe?

996
01:39:05,406 --> 01:39:06,498
Where is my BottIe?

997
01:39:11,612 --> 01:39:13,512
Who is it? Sakkarai?

998
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:17,307
Come out

999
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,112
l'm alone

1000
01:39:23,824 --> 01:39:24,848
Just me

1001
01:39:26,226 --> 01:39:27,056
Come and see

1002
01:39:48,382 --> 01:39:50,213
The gun isn't loaded

1003
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:53,745
Two conditions

1004
01:39:55,122 --> 01:39:56,555
Drop aII charges against us

1005
01:39:57,725 --> 01:39:59,488
And take your men and go

1006
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:07,226
You talk just like a police officer

1007
01:40:07,401 --> 01:40:09,164
Your wife is with us

1008
01:40:09,536 --> 01:40:11,094
She's still alive for now

1009
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:16,042
ls that a threat?
Join the police force

1010
01:40:16,477 --> 01:40:18,445
l came here to talk peace

1011
01:40:20,414 --> 01:40:21,779
l want peace too

1012
01:40:25,886 --> 01:40:28,787
No more bad blood

1013
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:33,456
Send Ragini back

1014
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:38,730
Veera will come to no harm

1015
01:40:46,507 --> 01:40:48,270
Come out when you want to talk

1016
01:40:52,379 --> 01:40:53,471
l'll be waiting in my tent

1017
01:41:04,324 --> 01:41:06,417
Do l tell Veera
you're ready to make peace?

1018
01:41:27,014 --> 01:41:28,982
Do l tell Veera
you're ready to make peace?

1019
01:41:37,558 --> 01:41:38,855
lt's only a scratch

1020
01:41:39,159 --> 01:41:40,387
Next time you won't be so lucky

1021
01:41:41,962 --> 01:41:43,987
-Veera told me, but l didn't
listen his words. -Don't run

1022
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:16,019
Hurry up!

1023
01:43:23,263 --> 01:43:29,964
A BattIe cry rings out

1024
01:43:47,955 --> 01:43:51,254
Like angry seas, two great armies
rush to the attack

1025
01:43:51,358 --> 01:43:54,794
Deafening as thunder,
chariots hurtIe forward

1026
01:43:55,796 --> 01:43:59,527
''An end to your arrogance.
The battle has begun''

1027
01:43:59,733 --> 01:44:02,827
Like angry seas, two great armies
rush to the attack

1028
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:06,099
Deafening as thunder,
chariots hurtIe forward

1029
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:16,238
''A warless day is no day''

1030
01:44:25,859 --> 01:44:30,489
''He will come with an army
and dethrone you''

1031
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,165
Hemanth, careful

1032
01:45:40,767 --> 01:45:43,235
Keep coming and you'll die

1033
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:56,240
A round of applause!

1034
01:45:56,650 --> 01:46:03,249
He isn't running.
He's flying

1035
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,438
Where is Ragini?

1036
01:46:35,555 --> 01:46:37,580
Where is my sister?

1037
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:44,562
Where is Vennila?
Where is she?

1038
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:01,247
This is the day you'll die

1039
01:47:01,681 --> 01:47:03,342
Say your prayers

1040
01:47:23,403 --> 01:47:25,633
''The virtuous tumbling to hell''

1041
01:47:54,234 --> 01:47:56,498
Come, sweetheart

1042
01:47:57,838 --> 01:48:00,466
No gun, no uniform, no back up

1043
01:48:00,607 --> 01:48:02,666
Just you and me

1044
01:48:08,281 --> 01:48:10,044
Come to me

1045
01:48:41,147 --> 01:48:45,846
Veera, let go

1046
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:48,110
Let him plummet to his death

1047
01:48:48,755 --> 01:48:50,586
Screaming

1048
01:49:35,468 --> 01:49:39,905
Where is he?
What's happened to him?

1049
01:49:41,308 --> 01:49:43,276
He's God for you

1050
01:49:44,978 --> 01:49:47,947
And me?
The ten-headed demon

1051
01:49:54,921 --> 01:49:56,548
Tell me he's all right

1052
01:50:08,969 --> 01:50:10,834
Don't make me beg

1053
01:50:11,671 --> 01:50:13,036
Say something

1054
01:50:16,443 --> 01:50:17,501
Tell me

1055
01:50:18,712 --> 01:50:19,644
Hold this

1056
01:50:22,882 --> 01:50:24,315
Alive? Right?

1057
01:50:30,991 --> 01:50:34,586
Seemed damn fit when
l last saw him

1058
01:50:36,830 --> 01:50:38,661
He was dangling...

1059
01:50:39,666 --> 01:50:41,759
...with one hand from a bridge

1060
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:47,868
Spitting fire.
So gutsy. A real hero

1061
01:50:48,842 --> 01:50:50,139
Hold tight

1062
01:50:52,112 --> 01:50:53,636
Don't you let go

1063
01:50:54,381 --> 01:50:56,406
Where's that lnspector?

1064
01:50:58,118 --> 01:51:00,951
Where is he?

1065
01:51:02,088 --> 01:51:03,885
There he is

1066
01:51:07,761 --> 01:51:10,662
Amazing. Slithering like a snake

1067
01:51:12,766 --> 01:51:14,461
Do me a favour

1068
01:51:14,734 --> 01:51:17,601
Only Gods do favours.
Not demons

1069
01:51:17,737 --> 01:51:19,102
Don't kill Dev

1070
01:51:19,372 --> 01:51:21,738
Come up and face me alone

1071
01:51:21,908 --> 01:51:23,239
l'll let go

1072
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:26,174
-Only one beast can survive
-l can shoot you

1073
01:51:26,279 --> 01:51:28,076
Who do you bet on?

1074
01:51:31,317 --> 01:51:34,809
Think l'd give you a loaded gun?

1075
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:58,274
l have always wondered
who would end up killing me

1076
01:52:00,747 --> 01:52:01,611
Shoot me...

1077
01:52:04,617 --> 01:52:06,551
...and, in a few minutes...

1078
01:52:06,853 --> 01:52:09,287
...the turmoil and the suffering

1079
01:52:14,394 --> 01:52:16,021
Everything will be snuffed out

1080
01:52:21,167 --> 01:52:24,000
Aim here.
And in an instant...

1081
01:52:25,438 --> 01:52:26,496
Memory

1082
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:28,198
Love

1083
01:52:29,776 --> 01:52:31,676
Desire.
Your very life

1084
01:52:33,947 --> 01:52:35,539
All gone. ln one go

1085
01:52:38,718 --> 01:52:39,742
Painless

1086
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:47,226
Looking at you, l'll die contented

1087
01:52:48,061 --> 01:52:51,121
With a smile on my face

1088
01:52:56,169 --> 01:52:59,434
And if l stayed, will you spare him?

1089
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,474
Will you stay?

1090
01:53:14,287 --> 01:53:15,447
Are you sure?

1091
01:53:36,509 --> 01:53:37,601
What are you doing?

1092
01:54:51,551 --> 01:54:54,748
You have a beard?
A 14-day growth?

1093
01:54:56,022 --> 01:54:58,388
You should've come for me in 14 minutes

1094
01:55:07,166 --> 01:55:08,155
You had me scared

1095
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:13,498
l'm back now

1096
01:55:15,608 --> 01:55:17,132
At last, l came to you

1097
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:25,873
Where is he?

1098
01:55:29,188 --> 01:55:32,214
Why do you ask?
l'm here

1099
01:55:32,392 --> 01:55:33,689
What more do you want?

1100
01:55:38,498 --> 01:55:39,624
Where's he hiding?

1101
01:55:42,635 --> 01:55:46,401
Did you come for me?
Or Veera?

1102
01:55:49,642 --> 01:55:51,769
He left you here and escaped

1103
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:54,010
Let it go

1104
01:55:54,314 --> 01:55:55,906
l'll be back

1105
01:56:02,355 --> 01:56:03,583
Take me home

1106
01:56:10,229 --> 01:56:11,958
Let's go home

1107
01:56:41,194 --> 01:56:42,354
Did he hit you?

1108
01:56:47,767 --> 01:56:48,995
Did he threaten you?

1109
01:56:51,637 --> 01:56:52,626
No

1110
01:56:59,412 --> 01:57:00,436
Did he touch you?

1111
01:57:06,152 --> 01:57:07,881
What happened that shouldn't have?

1112
01:57:16,129 --> 01:57:17,994
They kept you for 14 days

1113
01:57:18,831 --> 01:57:20,958
14 days and 14 nights

1114
01:57:22,902 --> 01:57:24,392
l know what you're asking

1115
01:57:25,204 --> 01:57:27,934
Look at me.
Can't you tell?

1116
01:57:33,479 --> 01:57:35,538
Will you take a lie detector test?

1117
01:57:36,015 --> 01:57:37,346
We'll soon know

1118
01:57:38,785 --> 01:57:40,616
How dare you talk like that?

1119
01:57:44,991 --> 01:57:47,516
lf you aren't lying,
why does the test bother you?

1120
01:57:49,395 --> 01:57:51,989
l just about survived 14 days

1121
01:57:52,832 --> 01:57:55,392
Now l wish that l were dead

1122
01:57:56,903 --> 01:57:59,371
The truth is sometimes harsh

1123
01:58:00,039 --> 01:58:02,837
How do you know the truth?

1124
01:58:05,678 --> 01:58:06,770
He told me

1125
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:11,717
Who told you? What?

1126
01:58:14,053 --> 01:58:15,884
My hands may be defiled

1127
01:58:16,622 --> 01:58:18,852
But your wife is not pure as gold

1128
01:58:19,192 --> 01:58:20,716
She's sullied

1129
01:58:22,829 --> 01:58:26,060
lmpossible. l don't believe it

1130
01:58:27,867 --> 01:58:29,095
He couldn't have said that

1131
01:58:30,203 --> 01:58:35,732
He said a lot more.
Shall l go on?

1132
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:36,866
Stop

1133
01:58:37,877 --> 01:58:39,504
l'm getting off this train

1134
01:58:40,313 --> 01:58:41,280
Don't threaten me

1135
01:58:42,982 --> 01:58:45,007
Are you throwing me out of your life?

1136
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:49,279
l don't like your lies

1137
01:58:52,925 --> 01:58:54,290
l never lie, Dev

1138
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:55,518
But you're lying now

1139
01:58:58,498 --> 01:59:00,022
Your face... all lies

1140
01:59:01,868 --> 01:59:03,199
Your body... more lies

1141
01:59:05,738 --> 01:59:07,000
lt shows in your eyes

1142
01:59:57,657 --> 01:59:59,022
You shouldn't have come back

1143
01:59:59,759 --> 02:00:02,421
Even if l knew where Veera was,
l shouldn't tell you

1144
02:00:02,528 --> 02:00:05,019
But you're asking me
to take you to him

1145
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:09,668
l don't know why you came back

1146
02:00:10,069 --> 02:00:14,005
lf you are still angry on him,
kindly go home

1147
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:18,041
Let Veera keep the regard he has for you

1148
02:00:19,946 --> 02:00:23,780
l don't know how long
you'll have to wait

1149
02:00:24,383 --> 02:00:27,045
l've left you something to eat

1150
02:02:06,585 --> 02:02:07,916
You're back

1151
02:02:14,694 --> 02:02:16,525
What did you tell Dev about me?

1152
02:02:16,929 --> 02:02:19,329
l'm out of breath.
l really can't hear you

1153
02:02:19,832 --> 02:02:21,322
l can't hear you?

1154
02:02:41,654 --> 02:02:43,645
Am l the weapon to defeat him?

1155
02:02:46,826 --> 02:02:48,521
l'm dizzy with happiness

1156
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:52,425
Don't be harsh

1157
02:02:55,935 --> 02:02:57,368
What did you tell Dev?

1158
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:08,672
What did you say?
Tell me

1159
02:03:23,596 --> 02:03:27,259
Hey, Veera

1160
02:03:29,435 --> 02:03:32,268
Let him plummet to his death

1161
02:03:32,772 --> 02:03:34,262
He'll die screaming

1162
02:03:37,676 --> 02:03:38,973
Hold on tight

1163
02:03:40,746 --> 02:03:42,577
l could kill you to win your wife

1164
02:03:49,021 --> 02:03:53,788
And l could spare you for her

1165
02:03:54,927 --> 02:03:59,887
Shall l leave you or save you?

1166
02:03:59,999 --> 02:04:02,593
Shall l leave?

1167
02:04:03,769 --> 02:04:05,703
What did you say about me?

1168
02:04:08,607 --> 02:04:11,269
You have a wife, pure as gold

1169
02:04:12,578 --> 02:04:16,708
Throw gold into fire..
..it becomes purer

1170
02:04:20,486 --> 02:04:22,545
Our hands may be defiled

1171
02:04:25,157 --> 02:04:26,647
But we have...

1172
02:04:28,961 --> 02:04:31,953
...protected your wife with great care

1173
02:04:39,138 --> 02:04:40,537
What else did you tell him?

1174
02:04:44,043 --> 02:04:48,707
Take her and go
before l change my mind

1175
02:04:54,987 --> 02:04:58,821
Hold
Come yourself up

1176
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:24,071
Veera is so happy,
how can you be upset?

1177
02:05:33,492 --> 02:05:36,120
Were you captive for only 14 days?

1178
02:05:39,398 --> 02:05:40,524
Only 14 days?

1179
02:05:43,836 --> 02:05:45,929
Why do 14 days
sometimes feel like a lifetime?

1180
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:52,606
l didn't feel so bad when l sent
you back, blindfolded

1181
02:05:54,780 --> 02:06:00,309
But why do l feel such happiness today?

1182
02:06:11,063 --> 02:06:12,030
No tears

1183
02:06:13,799 --> 02:06:16,029
Swallow those tears

1184
02:06:19,138 --> 02:06:20,435
l don't like women crying

1185
02:06:31,550 --> 02:06:32,608
l feel alive again

1186
02:06:35,454 --> 02:06:36,648
l can breathe again

1187
02:06:38,791 --> 02:06:43,524
Dev said vile things.
He didn't heed a word l said

1188
02:06:46,899 --> 02:06:48,161
Why did he talk like that?

1189
02:06:52,304 --> 02:06:53,703
Without any reason?

1190
02:06:57,276 --> 02:07:00,006
-He distrusts me
-Distrusts you?

1191
02:07:02,681 --> 02:07:03,613
The lnspector?

1192
02:07:29,141 --> 02:07:31,109
Well done!

1193
02:07:31,210 --> 02:07:32,370
Dev isn't here

1194
02:07:34,913 --> 02:07:36,107
Dev, you're so devious

1195
02:07:38,083 --> 02:07:39,948
Dev doesn't know l'm here

1196
02:07:40,686 --> 02:07:44,486
He really knows how to get to me

1197
02:07:46,692 --> 02:07:49,217
Come out
Show yourself

1198
02:08:24,296 --> 02:08:26,924
l told you l'd come back

1199
02:08:31,870 --> 02:08:36,273
Go on, shoot

1200
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:38,642
Shoot me

1201
02:08:41,113 --> 02:08:43,673
Not once. You'll have to
shoot me ten times

1202
02:08:43,782 --> 02:08:45,044
A hundred times

1203
02:08:45,451 --> 02:08:47,681
Shoot me

1204
02:08:48,854 --> 02:08:50,446
Shoot me!

1205
02:08:50,956 --> 02:08:51,923
Ragini, move

1206
02:08:52,024 --> 02:08:53,992
You can't destroy my happiness

1207
02:08:54,293 --> 02:08:55,260
Move

1208
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:57,157
You can't destroy it

1209
02:08:58,430 --> 02:08:59,795
Move

1210
02:09:35,067 --> 02:09:46,001
I wiII come again

1211
02:09:47,079 --> 02:09:57,580
Come Back to foIIow you

1212
02:09:59,424 --> 02:10:05,158
Is Iife a mere scriBBIing of a chiId..

1213
02:10:05,764 --> 02:10:11,566
..in which meaning is sought?

1214
02:10:12,404 --> 02:10:23,508
Life changes and ends
when the meaning is unraveIed

1215
02:10:30,113 --> 02:10:36,122
